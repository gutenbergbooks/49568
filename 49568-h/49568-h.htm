<h2>DEDICATION</h2>


<p class="noi">To the memory of Henry Chadwick, “The
Father of Baseball,” whose life was centered
in the sport, and who, by his rugged honesty
and his relentless opposition to everything
that savored of dishonesty and commercialism
in connection with the game, is entitled to the
credit, more than any other, of the high standing
and unsullied reputation which the sport
enjoys to-day, and to the boys who love the
great American game I dedicate this book.</p>

<small>THE WINTER TERM</small></h2>


<p>“Eyah! Eyah! Hughie, <span class="lcsmcaps">RAH-RAH</span>.” A wiry red-haired
boy about twenty-three years old swung lightly
from the train with a big valise in his hand into a
crowd of college boys in caps and heavy ulsters.
They gathered round him at once, and while one
crowd took charge of his valise, he was lifted on to
the shoulders of a half dozen fellows and carried
through the streets to his rooms in Elihu Dormitory.
In a twinkling his rooms and the halls outside were
blocked with the lads of Lowell who had come to
welcome the most popular boy in school, Hughie
Jenkins.</p>

<p>It was the day of the opening of the winter term
of the University. Hughie Jenkins had been the
successful manager for three years of the College
Baseball team and on the Thanksgiving Day previous,
Hughie as Captain of the Football Eleven,
with the help of the other members of the team, had
won the College Championship for the first time in
five years.</p>

<p>The boys of Lowell University had never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
very successful in football against their old rivals at
Jefferson, and the fellows were so chock-full of enthusiasm
over it that they had not yet had enough
opportunity to satisfy it. As each of the members of
the team had arrived he had been welcomed in much
the same way, but the great welcome was, of course,
given to “<a href="#image02">good old Hughie</a>” as they called him,
and now that he was with them again it was possible,
taking the boys’ view of it, for the work of the University
to go on.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 437px;">
<a name="image02" id="image02">
  <img src="images/image02.jpg" width="437" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_2">“Good old Hughie Jenkins was back.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>As Captain Larke had said, “Hughie is entitled to
all the credit we can give him. He has been a wonder
at baseball because he has always kept the boys fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
hard to win, no matter what the score was, and
we have won many a game just because we wanted to
do our best for him, and the way he made us get out
and win in the last few minutes of the big football
game kind of shows that he knows how to put them
over.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Kirkpatrick, who was right
end on the team, “if good old Hughie hadn’t put
some of the fight back in us when that old score was
0 to 0 in the last five minutes of play, and then himself
kicked that field goal from Jefferson’s twenty-five-yard
line, we wouldn’t have won.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Hughie, “this is fine all right, boys.
We did win, didn’t we! and it’s very kind of you to
try to give me all the credit, but if it hadn’t been for
the other ten fellows on the team, I guess I couldn’t
have done very much, and anyway it took eleven
pretty good men to beat that team from Jefferson.”</p>

<p>Then, turning to Johnny Everson he said, “Gee,
I wish the snow would melt. I’d like to find out what
kind of new fellows we have who can play baseball.”</p>

<p>And that was just like Hughie. Here it was
winter, with snow on the ground, and a month or
two of cold weather still in sight. He had hardly
got rested from the football campaign, and now he
was wishing it was time to get out the bats, balls,
and masks!</p>

<p>“It gets me,” said Delvin to Gibbie over in one
corner, “how that old boy hustles and is thinking
about all kinds of things all the time, but I guess
that’s the way to win out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“In time of peace prepare for war,” said Hughie.
“Now I am wondering right now whom we are
going to get to take the place of old boy Penny on
first (Fred Penny had been the sensation of the
college world at the first bag), and who will take
Johnny King’s place as catcher and will he be able
to work that delayed throw trick with Johnny Everson
and the shortstop? And by the way, who is going
to take Joe Brinker’s place at short, besides the couple
of other places that are vacant?</p>

<p>“Boys,” continued Hughie, “this is going to be my
last year at school here. You fellows have helped
me win the championship before. It’s all right about
the football business, but this last year with you,
we’ve simply got to have another winning nine.
Let’s give a good old cheer for the football boys, and
then let’s give another for the grand old game of
ball, and then you go and tell all the fellows who
can play ball that I want to see them in the cage
next week, and tell all of them that think they can
play ball to come, too. Sometimes some of these
chaps who think they can’t do it turn out the best
of all.”</p>

<p>And that evening when the boys got talking by
themselves they forgot all about football, and the
fellows who had been to school last year had to tell
all over again about the wonderful stunts that Lowell
boys had pulled off in the past, just as if most of
them hadn’t heard them all before.</p>

<p>“Say, Johnny,” said Fred Larke, a Junior from
Kansas and Captain of the Baseball Nine, to Johnny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Everson, “I was trying to tell Robb here (Robb
was from Georgia) how Johnny King and you and
Joe Brinker figured out that delayed-throw-to-second
trick that won that game from Princeville last year.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Johnny, “it didn’t really win the
game, you know, because we were ahead then, but
it kept the other fellows from winning. You see,
some one said to us in the visitors’ dressing room of
Bailey Oval that Walker of the Princeville team was
a slow thinker. ‘I have a new trick for fellows that
can’t think quick,’ said King, the catcher, and he explained
it to us so we would be on the job if the
chance came. Sure enough it did.</p>

<p>“In the last half of the ninth inning of the game
with Princeville College, the Lowell boys were one
run to the good. Princeville College was at bat, of
course.</p>

<p>“Walker, the first man up, had gotten to first on
a hit and reached second on a sacrifice and he was
the lad they said didn’t think quick. This was just
the thing we figured might happen. King had said,
‘If that fellow gets on second, I can pull off this
new trick, which I call the delayed throw. Let Joe
cover the bag and Johnny stall.’ On the first ball
pitched, this Walker took a big lead off second, and
Brinker covered the bag, King motioned quick as
if to throw, and I stood still. Walker first started
back toward second, but when he saw that King
didn’t throw he slowed down. Brinker, walking
back to his place at short, said to Walker, ‘We’d
have got you that time, old boy, if King had thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the ball.’ For just one fatal moment Walker
turned around to answer Brinker’s remark and in
that instant King threw the ball to me as I hustled
for the bag. Of course, I caught it and jabbed it
against the runner and before he knew how it was
done, he was out.</p>

<p>“Of course you couldn’t work that on a real live
player, but we won the game on that play because
the next batter drove out a long single on which
Walker could have scored. Looking at it one way,
it was won in the dressing room because that’s
where we fixed up the scheme.”</p>

<p>“It pays to keep thinking about the game all the
time, doesn’t it?” commented Larke.</p>

<p>That brought up the other story of another game
with Biltmore University a couple of years before
which Lowell lost, and Everson had to tell that, too.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t there,” said Everson, “because it was
two years ago, which was before my time, and there
was a whole lot of luck about it, too, but it was this
way. There were three on bases and Merry, our
mighty slugger, at bat with two out. Score was 3
to 0 against us and it was our last half of the ninth,
too; Merry hit the first ball pitched for a homer over
the right field fence, and four runs would have
scored, only for little Willie Keefer, right fielder
for Biltmore, who was playing well out toward the
fence.</p>

<p>“The grounds were down by the railroad and
right field was down hill and rough. Inside, the fence
sloped at an angle of 65 degrees, being straight on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the outside and covered with signs. Willie started
with the crack of the bat, leaped upon the slope of
the fence and started to run along it, going higher
and higher and <a href="#image01">just as the ball was going over his
head, straight as a bullet, he put up his right hand,
and caught the ball</a> fairly; then Willie went over
the fence with the ball in his mitt, rolling over in
the dirt.</p>

<p>“Willie climbed back over the fence, and the runs
didn’t count because while the umpire couldn’t see
it plainly, our fellows in the right bleachers could
see Willie all the time and they were, of course,
square enough to say that the ball was fairly caught,
even if it did lose the game for us.”</p>

<p>And so they talked and talked until long after
time to be in bed, and told all the stories about the
great Lowell clubs of the past, the great pitchers,
the catchers and the fielders; and the fellows called
it the first meeting of the Hot Stove League of
Lowell University 19—. This talking League
lasted through part of February, by which time the
freshies who had done wonders on the high-school
teams at home, and who had come to Lowell with
high hopes of making the team, had a pretty good
idea of the kind of enthusiasm and loyalty and,
most important, the hard work they would have to
show to get on the team at Lowell.</p>

<p>The night of Hughie Jenkins’ return a boyish-looking
chap, who had come all the way from California
to Lowell University, only five months before,
wrote a long letter to his folks back home, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
among other things he said the boys had begun to
talk baseball, and he was going to try to be on the
team and also that he was going to try for the position
of pitcher. Further, that he was going to try
for one of the Jerry Harriman Prizes. His name
was Case.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>THE LOWELL SPIRIT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Lowell University wasn’t one of those little
colleges about which books for boys are often written,
nor was it just a big college. It was the greatest
University in the East. It had thousands of students
and hundreds of teachers. It was a rich college
with dozens of buildings. A great many hundreds
of the boys who had been graduated from it, poor
boys and rich boys and medium-fortuned boys, now
held high positions in the big world outside.</p>

<p>Two of the boys who had attended school there
years before and who had played on its athletic teams
had become Presidents of the United States, and
every year while these men were in the White House
they came to attend the big football and baseball
games, and acted just like boys again, while the
games were going on at least. Other boys had been
made members of the Cabinet and a great many had
become Senators and Representatives in Congress
while still others had become famous ministers, doctors
and merchants.</p>

<p>The students were made up of sons of rich families
and poor alike. Boys from the farms and from
the city. Of those who were lucky in having rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
fathers, there were quite a number at school every
year. Some of them had finely furnished rooms,
servants, automobiles and other things which a rich
man’s son generally has, and it must be said that a
great many, in fact, most of these boys developed
into men of fine character and ability, and made their
marks in the world.</p>

<p>A few thought they were better than those who
didn’t have so much spending money, but they didn’t
get very far or do so much in the world, either in
school or after they got out.</p>

<p>The spirit of Lowell was democratic, and with
the exception of these foolish fellows, the sons of the
rich associated with the poor fellows, particularly
where the honor and fame of the school were at stake.</p>

<p>The poor fellows associated with the rich boys
whenever they got a chance. They lived in cheaper
rooms and worked a little harder, because the bright
boys soon figured out that they would have to hustle
to keep up with the rich fellows.</p>

<p>Some of them worked during the vacations and
earned enough money to keep them at school during
the winter just as they do at other colleges, and some
of them looked after furnaces around town, or waited
on tables at the boarding houses and did other things
to assure their schooling. Fully as many of the poor
fellows who had been graduated had become rich
and famous in life, and one of the two who had become
President of the United States was a poor
farmer’s boy.</p>

<p>The Faculty of the University wanted the students<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to mix with each other and didn’t want any difference
to be shown between rich boys and poor, so they encouraged
all athletic games, and this brought about
exactly what they wanted. There is nothing like
athletics to put boys on a common ground, and a
fellow was always welcome to show what he could do.</p>

<p>They had a fine athletic association. The equipment
was the best that money could buy. The best
coaches in the world were secured to train the boys in
the different sports, and everything was done in a
business-like way. This made it possible to select
the teams on merit alone.</p>

<p>Any fellow who thought he could do something
in the line of college sports had only to report for a
trial at the proper time, and at the place called for
in the notice, and he was given a chance to show
what he could do. The merit system picked him out
and in that way the best possible team was secured.
If he had done one thing better than some other fellow,
he got the job, and he could keep it until some
other fellow who could do it better turned up and
pushed him out of the position.</p>

<p>If a fellow thought he could pitch he was given
a chance to show what he could do before the coach
who was engaged especially to try out the pitchers.
If the coaches thought he “had it in him,” they would
bring it out. Very often, some young fellow showed
up who proved to be a wonder, and he got on the
Varsity the first year.</p>

<p>This spirit attracted from all over the country
boys who wanted to enter college. It made college<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
life very attractive and more students came every
year, and somehow Lowell University got more and
more in the habit of having winning teams in most
college sports. Likewise, it was usually Lowell
boys who carried off the lion’s share of the Jerry Harriman
Scholarships in baseball.</p>

<p>In baseball, Lowell had most always been the
champion. Her basketball and hockey teams were
only beaten when outlucked; her crew was beaten
but twice in twenty years. Only in football did she
seem to fall behind. Year after year she would
get a team together that would win its way through
the games with the other schools in the East, hardly
ever scored against, only to fall before her old time
rival college in the West in the final game of the
year. This happened in spite of the fact that all of
the cunning and ability of her coaches, captains and
managers were used to get a team together that could
beat Jefferson College.</p>

<p>But this past fall they had finally turned the trick
against Jefferson and won for the first time in five
years. Half-back last year and Captain and Half-back
this year, good old Hughie Jenkins who had
won the baseball Championship three times, had
done it, and now he was back after the Christmas
vacation, and when he had time to think about something
besides his studies he would be thinking about
baseball and the gaps in last year’s winner that would
have to be filled because the old standbys like Fred
Penny, Johnny King, Joe Brinker and others had
been graduated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Hughie one evening about the
middle of January, to his roommate and chum,
Johnny Everson, “I have about five weeks before
the 15th of February to dream that the new fellows
who think they can play ball are going to be as good
as the old boys and I am going to have another winner
this year, if—well, we just have to win the Championship
this year, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Little did he know that among those who had
seen him on the day he got back after the holidays,
were almost a half dozen boys who had been in
school only five months who would make the Varsity
this year, and whose names would be written very
near the top of the Roll of Honor in Lowell’s Hall
of Fame, and that another fellow, one who was destined
to be greater than all the rest, had not yet
arrived.</p>

<small>GETTING ACQUAINTED</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Harold Case mounted the stairs of his boarding
house to the little hall room that he had called home
for the last five months. It had been his first time
away from home and he was lonesome and maybe
just a little homesick, for he had come all the way
from California to attend school at Lowell. Though
he was a poor boy, he had never had to look out for
himself before.</p>

<p>Perhaps his room—there was only one small one—helped
to make him lonesome. It was comfortably
furnished and the meals which Mrs. Malcolm
served her student boarder were good, but this was
Harold’s first white winter. He had lived all of
his eighteen years in the balmy climate of the Golden
State, and he missed the warm sun and the bright
green of the orange leaves and the yellow fruit which
he had been used to back home, and he hadn’t become
accustomed to wearing overcoat and rubbers
yet as they did every day here in the East.</p>

<p>He had just come in from class. His feet were
wet and he was cold and the register which was
supposed to heat his room was cold; for the weather
was beginning to get mild for Eastern folks, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
had let the furnace fire get low. But it was still too
cold and chilly for this boy from the far West, and
he was wishing he were back among the fruit groves
near his home.</p>

<p><a href="#image03">He was lonesome</a>, too, because he missed the
chums back home. He had not been fortunate in
making friends during his few months at college.
Boys are apt to make friends through the games they
play together and Harold was not familiar with the
boys’ sports that are indulged in during the cold New
England winters.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 431px;">
<a name="image03" id="image03">
  <img src="images/image03.jpg" width="431" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_15">“He was lonesome.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>He had never had a pair of skates on in his life
and didn’t know what it was to skim over the smooth
ice with a pair of sharp steel blades fastened to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
shoes. He had never enjoyed the sensation of coasting
or hitching on to bob-sleds, nor had he ever seen
snow before coming to Lowell.</p>

<p>Think of living eighteen years, and going to school
two-thirds that long, and never being mixed up in a
snowball fight!</p>

<p>So you see the fact that it was winter and only
winter sports were indulged in put Harold out of it
for the time being, and because he wasn’t used to the
climate, and didn’t know what fun winter sports
would provide, he rather felt that he didn’t care for
them, and the other fellows paid little attention to
him, and he had not made any friends.</p>

<p>This was hard luck of course, and if the other boys
had thought about it at all, they would no doubt have
encouraged him to join them, but they were not particularly
interested at the moment in anyone who
didn’t like the things they liked.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Harold, as they called him
back home, was a really good fellow. He was very
boyish looking for his eighteen years. He was a
well built fellow, but modest and somewhat backward
about pushing himself forward. His hair was
brown and his features were good although no one
would call him handsome. His eyes were light blue
and clear, his mouth was firm, and if the other fellows
only knew it, he was as quick as a flash in any game
he was familiar with, and he was as graceful as a
deer in motion. He could run almost as fast as
a deer, too.</p>

<p>His parents were not in easy circumstances and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
was harder than Harold knew for Mr. Case to spare
the money which he did to send him to Lowell.
Harold would perhaps have been just as well pleased
to attend a college in California (just now when he
thought of the cold Eastern winter he wished to
goodness that he had), but his father had been a
Lowell man, having been graduated with the class
of 18—, and while it was a little hard on him financially
to do so, he had always wanted Harold to be
a Lowell man, and he was willing to work a little
more out there in California to do what he wanted
for his son. He felt sure Harold would make his
mark in the world and he also had an idea that his
boy would add something to the fame of Lowell one
way or the other.</p>

<p>At the same time the understanding was that after
he got out of school and began to earn money, Harold
was to pay back this college money, and so while
there was enough to be fairly comfortable for his
first year, the young fellow always kept in mind the
fact that he was in a way living on borrowed money,
and that the less he spent the smaller the amount
would be to be paid back.</p>

<p>For this reason, he had secured a room in a somewhat
cheaper and quieter part of town, some distance
away from the campus, instead of taking up his
quarters in one of the Students’ Halls, and this fact
also, and because he was in a house with no other
students, served to keep him from making friends as
easily as he might. If he had been living where
there were a lot of other fellows he would not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
been so lonesome, and the boys at Lowell would
have known sooner what a grand fellow he was.</p>

<p>Harold looked at his watch to see how long it
would be to dinner time, for he had a good appetite
even if he was cold, and just then the dinner gong
sounded. He went down to the dining room where
he found Mrs. Malcolm and her young son, a lad
of twelve, already seated at table. The dinner was
good, and Harold noticed a more cheerful air in
Mrs. Malcolm’s conversation. This was rather a
surprise as there had been a noticeable lack of laughter
in the house lately, at least so he had been thinking.</p>

<p>Mrs. Malcolm was a widow and had come to the
college town, thinking she could add something to
the small income left her by her husband by establishing
herself in the boarding-house business. She
had three other rooms to rent, but up to this time
Harold had been the only boarder she was lucky
enough to get, and lately she had been a little bit
discouraged. With a larger house than she needed
for herself and son and only one boarder, the increased
expense was more than Harold was paying
her, so she was losing money on her idea.</p>

<p>This evening, however, she was more cheerful,
and she soon gave the reason. She had secured
two other students as boarders that day. One was
to come that evening, and had taken the room next to
Harold’s on the same floor, and the other had taken
the little room over his on the third floor, but this
fellow only rented the room with the privilege of
taking his meals where he pleased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“The young man who is coming to-night is a
freshman like yourself,” said Mrs. Malcolm. “His
home is in Texas; I think you will like him and it will
be real nice for you to have some one else in the
house. His name is Hagner.”</p>

<p>When dinner was over Harold went up to his
room to do some studying.</p>

<p>“I feel as though I could be chums with a Mexican
greaser to-night,” thought Harold, “and I certainly
will be glad to meet him.”</p>

<p>Shortly afterward the door bell rang and Harold
heard an expressman bringing a trunk up the stairs,
followed by the footsteps of a young man and also
a lighter step, no doubt that of Mrs. Malcolm.
After a few moments there was a knock at his door,
and when he opened it Mrs. Malcolm asked him if
she might introduce him to the new boarder,
Mr. Hagner.</p>

<p>Harold found a big, raw-boned, awkward-looking
German, a young fellow about six feet tall, weighing
fully 175 pounds. He was heavy set, bow-legged,
and had massive shoulders and long arms, but when
he moved around there was a wonderful ease and
grace apparent in his movements, which was a surprise.</p>

<p>Mrs. Malcolm soon went out and left the two
together in Hagner’s room. Harold started to leave,
too, saying that he would come in after Hagner
had unpacked.</p>

<p>“Don’t need to go for that reason,” said Hagner,
as he opened his trunk, ready to unpack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, if you don’t mind,” said Harold.
“I’m kind of lonesome to-night, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked the other, “anything
gone wrong?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Harold, “but you see I’m from California
and I don’t like this blamed snow and cold.
I’d rather be back where it’s warm every day like
I’m used to.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been here?” asked Hagner.
“This must be your first year, too?”</p>

<p>“It is. I’ve been here five months and it’s been
mighty cold for three months of that time. When
did you come?”</p>

<p>“I just got in yesterday,” said Hagner, starting
to unpack. “Never saw snow before in my life.
I am from Texas myself and we don’t have it down
there either. It’s wet, ain’t it? Don’t like it much
myself. Guess I’ll have to stand it, though. Don’t
expect to see Texas again for a couple of years,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>Harold began to feel more cheerful. Here was
a fellow to whom he could tell about college. Compared
with Hagner, Harold was an old timer, and he
began to feel good. Hagner kept on taking things
out of his trunk. He was having a hard time, getting
something out that seemed to be laid in crosswise
between the clothes. Harold looked, and <a href="#image04">just
then out it came, and there stood Hagner with an
old baseball bat in his hand</a>. He reached in with
his left and pulled out an old fielder’s mitt, which had
a big hole right through the middle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 428px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Harold’s eyes bulged. “Do you play ball?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“A little,” said the other; “used to play around
the back lots down home. Had to play hookey from
Sunday school to get a chance. Had to work week
days after school. You play?”</p>

<p>“Some,” said Harold.</p>

<p>“What position?”</p>

<p>“Pitcher,” said Harold, falling into the other’s
way of talking. “What’s your place?”</p>

<p>“Short,” said Hagner.</p>

<p>“Going to try for the team?” asked Harold.</p>

<p>“Will if they want me. You?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to make them want me. The best
pitcher they had last year is gone and they need
some one.”</p>

<p>“Better try for something else. Everybody thinks
he can pitch. Only a few know how.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m a Southpaw pitcher, and I was pretty
good on the High School team out home. Southpaws
are scarce.”</p>

<p>“Left handed, eh! You look quick, too. Think
you might make a first baseman.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather pitch,” said Harold.</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” said Hagner. “You can pitch
if you want to and if they want you, but if they
give me a chance any place, I think I can stop
them all right, and if I miss one occasionally, I
think I can hold the job with my bat. What’s
your first name? Mine’s John, but you can call me
Hagner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“My first name is Harold, but you had better
call me by my last name, too.”</p>

<p>And so they talked baseball until long after midnight,
and their enthusiasm for the great American
game made them friends at once, and Harold went
to bed feeling that the world was bright and warm
and that spring would be coming pretty soon, and he
made up his mind right there not to get homesick
any more, but to dig more into his studies so that
his marks wouldn’t interfere with the amount of time
he wanted to give to baseball when practice started.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>THE JERRY HARRIMAN SCHOLARSHIP PRIZES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>When Lowell University won the college baseball
Championship in 1876 the victory was to a large extent
due to the wonderful all-round work of Jerry
Harriman. As a pitcher he had never up to that
time had an equal, and he could play almost any
other position on the team well. In those days a
club would have only one pitcher and he was expected
to pitch almost every game of the season,
which often meant pitching every day in the week
but Sunday. When not pitching he played an outfield
position.</p>

<p>This is a whole lot different than the way the game
is conducted in the colleges to-day. In these days a
nine will sometimes have half a dozen pitchers and
they don’t do anything but pitch and then only in their
regular turns. Besides being a great pitcher Jerry
was also a great batter. This was also unusual because
very seldom do you find a good pitcher who
can bat, but Jerry could both pitch and bat and he
made a great name for himself as a college athlete.</p>

<p>After he had been graduated he went into business
in a city in the Middle West, and became very
wealthy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>As a young lad he had been weak physically and
his heart was said to be affected. In fact, he was not
expected to live to grow up. When he was thirteen
years old the doctors said he couldn’t live a year.
There came to his home town, however, about this
time, a young man who opened a school of Physical
Culture. He had a wonderfully well developed
body, was a great enthusiast on athletics, and he made
a great effort to get the young boys around town who
were weak physically to come to him.</p>

<p>He made his living by forming gymnasium
classes among the business men of the town and by
his work with them got many a staid old business
man, who was constantly confined to his office, into
the habit of taking exercise regularly, and he made
many a man who had become fat and sick through
lack of exercise strong again physically.</p>

<p>But he had a particular interest in the boys and he
was especially fond of getting up classes for poor
young fellows who were, as said before, undeveloped
and weak. He taught these youngsters for nothing
what he knew about the fine results of taking exercise
regularly, and many a poor fellow who would have
died young, he developed into a strong and healthy
young man who lived long and became prominent
in business and politics.</p>

<p>Among the young fellows who came to the attention
of this Professor Mitchell was young Harriman,
who by this time, however, was so weak that he
couldn’t join any of the classes. In fact, Jerry
couldn’t walk across the room without holding on to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
chair or something, and even the Professor had some
doubts as to his ability to do anything for him.</p>

<p>However, the case interested him and he came
every day to the house for some weeks and had Jerry
do such exercises as he could. At first there was
no improvement that could be noticed, but after a
couple of months of the most careful and lightest
exercise possible, a very decided improvement began
to be noticed. Very soon, by carefully doing exactly
as the Professor told him, Jerry began to get stronger,
until by the end of the first year all trace of his heart
trouble had disappeared and the Professor told him
that if he would only make it his business to take his
exercises every day he would some day be as strong
as any boy.</p>

<p>It is not the idea of this chapter to go into all the
details of how Harriman became a strong young
man. It is only fair to say, however, that to him
his regular and systematic exercise became as important
as his meals or washing his face, night and morning.
When he saw how exercise was improving him
physically he became almost a crank on the subject.</p>

<p>At any rate, he made a resolution that some day
he would be just as well developed physically as any
athlete in the world, and he kept this idea foremost
in his thoughts, because he could see that if he had
a perfect physical development, his mental capacity
would increase in proportion. In the end he became
a wonderfully well developed lad and was a living
example of what exercise will do for a boy, or man
either, for that matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>During this time he went to school, and soon was
able to join the games of the other boys. In the
High School and in the Preparatory College he went
in for athletics, and by the time he entered Lowell,
even he laughed when anybody recalled the fact that
seven or eight years before the doctors had given
him up to an early death from heart trouble.</p>

<p>It has been necessary to give this much of the details
of this part of his life in order to show what
it meant to Harriman to become the greatest pitcher
who had ever been in the box for any college in the
country, and also to give the boys who read this
good reason for his great interest in college athletics,
after he had gone into business and become wealthy,
as shown by the scholarship prizes which he gave
each year to the best athletes in the various colleges
of the country.</p>

<p>A Jerry Harriman Scholarship meant free tuition
and Five Hundred Dollars per year for living expenses
at any college in the country selected by the
winner, for the complete college course. Mr. Harriman
was liberal in the number of scholarship prizes
offered. Several young fellows, generally poor boys,
were presented each year with a complete college education.
There was a scholarship for the best all-round
football player, for basketball, for hockey and
each of the track and field events.</p>

<p>The scholarships were awarded by the Intercollegiate
Athletic Association, and were given without
restriction to the one chosen by the Association, except
that a nominee’s college had to submit to Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Harriman a record of the prize winner’s standing in
his studies. In this particular a good average standing
was required. It was the argument of Mr. Harriman
that the pursuit of athletics in college need not
interfere with a fellow’s studies and that if you give
a boy a well developed body his brain will get the
benefit of it, and with an average record as a student,
any boy might be expected to make his way in the
world.</p>

<p>Now baseball was the game which Jerry Harriman
liked above all others. He liked best to see it
played and to play it himself, and so when he came
to make up his list of scholarship prizes he gave the
baseball fellows the best of it. He was then and
still is a real “fan.” He loved to see new stars
developed on the diamond.</p>

<p>He thought it was the best and squarest game in
the world and he wanted his boys, as he called all
college boys, to love and play the game. Therefore
he had always offered four scholarships in baseball,
one for the leading pitcher, one for the leading infielder,
one for the leading outfielder and batter, and
one for the best all-round infielder and batsman.</p>

<p>Naturally, having been the baseball champions for
so long, the Lowell nine generally got most of these
scholarship prizes and it was very pleasing to Mr.
Harriman to see his old college secure so many
of them.</p>

<p>The talk around the University wherever the students
gathered often came around to these scholarship
prizes, especially as the time for baseball approached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Fellows like Jenkins, Larke, Everson and other of
the older fellows, some of whom had won them in
years past, would bring up the subject when they
noticed any of the young freshmen around, just to
get them to thinking about it, and a good many
youngsters had developed an ambition to try for a
scholarship and some of them to win one, just from
hearing these older fellows talk. And generally these
talks would turn from a discussion of the records of
winners of the prizes to the most thrilling performances
of the individual stars.</p>

<p>The day of the first meeting in the cage called by
Hughie, to give him a chance to look over the candidates
for the team, was the first time that Case and
Hagner had been present at one of these talks.</p>

<p>Hughie had given a general talk about the game
and had talked with each of the candidates, asking
various questions, such as “what position do you
play?” “Can you bat? Can you pitch?” etc.
After they had all thrown the ball around for an
hour, just playing catch so that Hughie could notice
the way the different fellows threw and swung, they
sat around gossiping with each other, nobody wanting
to go home, when one of the older fellows would
say something about the Scholarship Prizes.</p>

<p>Generally there was some one present who didn’t
know the details and this offered a chance to tell all
about the prizes.</p>

<p>In this case it was Hagner, who had been at school
only a few weeks, and all he knew about the prizes
was what Case had been able to tell him. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Everson had finished explaining the prizes fully the
talk, as usual, drifted on to the wonderful records of
the prize winners of the past. Not that sensational
catches or such other stunts as unassisted triple plays
would in themselves secure one of the prizes, for
they would not.</p>

<p>Only the official scorer’s records showing the
standing of the candidates were considered, but it was
generally the fellow who had the best record for any
given position who got the chance to pull off the
thrilling plays, because only the good players can
do the wonderful things.</p>

<p>When the talk turned to fielders who had been
famous on some of the old Lowell teams, it wasn’t
long before they were telling stories about great
catches made by some of the fielders on championship
teams of years gone by.</p>

<p>On such occasions Fred Larke never forgot to tell
about that great catch made by Jimmy Ryan. How
he in one game jumped clear over the fence in right
field which separated the bleachers from the playing
field, and caught a fly ball while falling into the
crowd.</p>

<p>Johnny Everson then had to tell his story of
Hughie Jenkins’ greatest catch, when he was playing
short in one of the Biltmore College games. There
was an enormous crowd out. The stands wouldn’t
hold them all, so they were let out on the field and
there were so many that they crowded close to the
base lines. In the ninth inning the score was tied,
one out, and Bill Everett of Biltmore College on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
third. The batter hit a high foul ball into the
crowd back of third base. Some of them were
seated but most of them were standing. <a href="#image05">Jenkins</a>
hustled across from his position at short, <a href="#image05">hurled himself
through the air</a> without paying any attention to
the crowd, caught the ball fair and square and then
fell in among the spectators. That made two out,
but Hughie was after the third one. Bill Everett
touched third after the catch and started for home.
Hughie couldn’t see but he guessed that Everett had
started. He climbed up out of the crowd, stepped
on the people he had knocked down, and threw to the
plate without looking. The ball went straight into
the catcher’s mitt and Everett was out easily. In
the next inning Lowell won the game.</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_30">“Jenkins hurled himself through the air.”</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, of course, Miner Black had to tell his remarkable
catch story about Jimmie Siegel in a twenty
inning game with Eastern Pennsylvania. How in
the eighteenth inning with a runner on first base, the
mightiest hitter of the Pennsylvania nine drove a
hard hit ball to left center. Just at that moment,
however, Siegel had put his hand in his hip pocket
to get out his handkerchief, as the day was hot and
the game was a hard one.</p>

<p>Jimmie, of course, started after the ball, and made
an effort to pull his hand out of his pocket while running.
It wouldn’t come out. He jerked and
jerked and still it stuck. Meantime the ball had to
be caught on the run and Jimmie had to make a try
for it some way. He leaped in the air, twisted, stuck
up his left hand and caught it with his back to the
diamond. Jimmie threw the ball into the diamond
with his left hand. Strange to say his right hand
then came out of his pocket easily. He wiped the
perspiration off his face, grinned, and the crowd went
wild for they realized why he had gone after it with
one hand.</p>

<p>After such talks the “freshies,” who had made
some pretty fine catches on the back lots at home,
always made a resolution to do something equally
startling when they got on the Varsity, and the candidates
at Lowell this year were a good deal like all
the other freshmen candidates who had gone before
them in this respect. This really was a good thing
for the boys, although, of course, many of them never
realized their ambitions for such fame.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>THE FIRST LINE-UP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Well, what do you think of your freshman
phenoms?”</p>

<p>It was Johnny Everson who was speaking. Johnny
besides being the regular second baseman of the
Varsity was the chum of Hughie Jenkins, the manager
of the team and his chief adviser with Captain
Larke. Johnny knew the game from top to bottom
and across the middle. They called him “a little
bunch of brains and nerves,” and he deserved the
compliment.</p>

<p>He was small in size, but large in brains and many
a game had been won for the college by his quick
work at trying moments, to say nothing of the fact
that he was largely responsible for the discovery and
development of many of the plays which had come
to be known as “inside baseball.” He had an aggressive
chin which seemed to be always pointing
forward, and his eye was as quick and accurate as a
sharpshooter’s.</p>

<p>“We seem to have a good many gaps to fill and
I guess we will find mostly yaps to fill them with,”
he went on; “anyway that’s the way I feel to-night
after looking over the unpromising material that we
put through the stunts at the cage to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t feel discouraged. You can never tell,
of course, on one trial, but watching some of those
youngsters this afternoon made me think that with
a little training some of them will make good,” said
Hughie.</p>

<p>“Let’s go over the list and mark the fixtures we
can count on, and then we can tell what we have to
do to get a real nine together,” said Everson.</p>

<p>“All right. At second we have <em>you</em>,” said Hughie,
“and I guess we won’t need to worry about the Keystone
bag, and at third we have Delvin, who I think,
will develop this year into a great star at the near
station. Captain Larke will handle left field all
right as usual, Miner Black will come back stronger
than ever this year in the box, and George Gibbs
will, I think, do the catching all right. That’s just
about half a team, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Now, at the first sack we need somebody to
take Penny’s place, and I must confess that I did not
notice any likely candidate, unless it was Dill.”</p>

<p>“We are going to have a hard time, I think, to
find some one at short in place of our good friend
Joe Brinker.”</p>

<p>“Did you notice the bowlegged and awkward-looking
German named Hagner in the cage to-day?”
broke in Everson. “If he wasn’t so big and awkward
looking, he might be able to bat and we could
play him in the outer gardens, but I hardly think he
would ever make a shortstop.”</p>

<p>“I hardly think so either,” said Jenkins, “but I
had a talk with him and he said he could play short.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
I have also had a report from Texas, where he came
from, that he is a perfect terror at bat. I can hardly
hope though that he will be able to fill Brinker’s
place. I think if we could figure out some scheme
to remodel his anatomy we might be able to make
something out of him. Still he may be a diamond
in the rough. I don’t think you can tell anything
about any of them until you see them work in the
open air for a week or two.”</p>

<p>“What do you think about right field?” asked
Johnny.</p>

<p>“If I am not mistaken,” answered Hughie, “we
have the real prize package in that young chap from
Georgia, Robb (a regular cracker name, isn’t it)?
Did you notice him at all? Did you ever see more
speed? I am knocking on wood when I talk about
him, because I don’t want to fool myself, but if I
was a scout for a professional team, and saw this
fellow Robb playing ball on some back lot, I think
I’d buy him without instructions from headquarters.”</p>

<p>“Lots of them look like stars the first few days
of spring,” said Johnny. “I noticed Robb particularly,
too. I was thinking that while he is a clean-cut
looking fellow, I’d hate to get into a fight with
him, because he looks like a chap who has no fear
of anything.”</p>

<p>“Besides Robb there were half a dozen others
who looked like they might be made into fielders,”
said Hughie. “There was Talkington, McKee,
Raymur, Oakley, Lunley, and Flack. If any of
them know how to swing a bat, I think we will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
able to teach them what they need to know about
catching flies.”</p>

<p>“As usual most of the candidates want to pitch
and if Miner is all right this year we won’t need any
one to help him, except, perhaps, a left-hander. Did
you notice anything promising along this line? I
was so busy looking over the fielders and possible
first basemen that I didn’t pay much attention to the
pitchers. I rather liked the delivery of Crossley the
short time he was throwing. He looked promising
for a rich man’s son.”</p>

<p>“Besides that will be easier when old man Young
gets here and we get them out for coaching. You
can also pick them out in batting practice. Just tell
them to throw straight swift balls over the plate
and you can pick out the poor ones anyhow, because
a pitcher who can’t put a straight ball over nine
times out of ten, isn’t worth developing. Then by
the time Young gets a chance at them for a week
we’ll know which are no good at all, and what ones
it will pay him to coach.”</p>

<p>“I had a talk,” said Johnny, “with that California
lad, Case. He is a quiet chap and unassuming.
He says he is a southpaw pitcher too, and he
may be what we are looking for.”</p>

<p>A few days after this talk in Hughie’s room the
snow began to melt and within a week Lowell field,
which had for months been covered with snow and
ice, suddenly took on a greenish look, the ground became
dry and firm and everyone began to feel the
spring in the air. One day, not long after, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
appeared upon the bulletin board the following
notice:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>University Baseball. Outdoor practice. On
the field at 1 <span class="lcsmcaps">P. M.</span> February 25th. Candidates
must bring their own suits.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Hugh Jenkins</span>, <i>Manager</i>.
</p></div>

<p>There was joy in the hearts of the hundred, for
there were about that number who hoped to be
picked for the Varsity. Out of the hundred, at
least ninety were certain to be disappointed as far
as the Varsity was concerned, for there were only
about ten places to fill, counting the substitutes.</p>

<p>Of course, there was a chance that a fellow would
get on the second squad which might help him to
the Varsity next year, and then there was always the
freshman team which was formed last and which
generally was an all pitcher team, so to speak, because
every man on it had nursed secret hopes of
making the Varsity his first year, as a pitcher.</p>

<p>Harold Case was out early. He had come to the
field with Hagner and was now sitting on the steps
of the clubhouse waiting for Hagner, who had become
his good friend. It was a strange friendship
that had sprung up between these two—the tall big-boned
and awkward German lad, almost a man in
looks, and this young and exceedingly graceful Western
lad, and both were profiting by it.</p>

<p>While he was sitting there, what was left of last
year’s champions trotted out on the field. Gibbs,
second catcher last year, and Larke, old cronies;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Black and Delvin; and last of all, of course, the inseparables,
Everson and Jenkins. The rest of the
candidates straggled out on to the field in twos and
threes, to the number of fully a hundred, and presently
Hagner came out with his old bat and glove
in hand and Harold got up and they walked over to
the diamond together.</p>

<p>“Better not let yourself out any to-day,” said
Hagner, as they approached the others who had already
paired off and were tossing balls back and
forth to each other.</p>

<p>Before Harold had time to answer, however, Jenkins
had said the same thing practically.</p>

<p>“Getting ready for a baseball season isn’t quite
like developing a football team,” said Hughie. “In
football you have to get the team in shape for one
or two big games, each of them requiring a terrific
outburst of energy, without thinking about the morrow,
but in the case of a baseball nine you have to
develop your bodies to withstand the strain of a long
series of games, mostly in warm weather, and you
must start slowly and get into condition gradually,
so do not try to do it all to-day.</p>

<p>“Another thing, in football we train the team to
withstand hard knocks, a sort of bull-dog development,
while a baseball team must have the nice
strength of a greyhound so as to enable it to keep
going at top speed for a long time, and so I want
you to go easy.”</p>

<p>So he had them stand in circles, making five or
six groups, and pass around medicine balls, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
exercise to strengthen the trunk muscles. Then they
paired off again, and tossed the baseball to each
other two by two—gently—just like boys playing
catch.</p>

<p>All at once Hughie called out, “Come on, boys,
around the field,” and starting off in front he trotted
all the way round the field along the fence. By the
time they got started on the second round a lot of the
fellows were puffing and blowing hard and found
it difficult to keep up, but Hughie knew how important
it was for a ball player to have wind and he
knew this kind of a stunt practiced a couple of times
a day would fix them up in good shape by the time
the games started.</p>

<p>Then he called them all up to the plate for batting
practice, and asked if there was any fellow around
who could pitch. He knew, of course, that Miner
Black was there, but Miner knew enough not to say
anything. What Hughie wanted was to find out
what kind of control these new fellows who thought
they could pitch had with a slow straight ball.
Hughie and Coach Young, who had arrived, stood
back of the plate with Everson and Larke watching.</p>

<p>Out of the dozen youngsters who said they would
try he picked out Hackett and told him to go into
the box.</p>

<p>“Now go ahead,” said Hughie. “Don’t use any
curves and don’t try to burn them over; just give us
some slow straight balls and try to get them across
the plate.”</p>

<p>What he really was trying to do besides give the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
men batting practice was to get a line on the new
pitching material, and this was the best way to get it.</p>

<p>Then he had the batters take turns at the plate,
and each fellow was expected to stay there until he
had made a hit, Hughie standing by showing each,
especially the new ones, how to stand up to the ball
and meet it fairly. Hackett, the first pitcher, didn’t
seem to be able to get them anywhere near the plate,
and so Hughie told the next one, Crossley, to go in
and give it a trial. He was a little better, but they
had finally to call on Miner to put a few over.</p>

<p>As usual, Miner was long on control. Johnny
Everson stepped to the plate. Miner served one up
and bing! The ball went scurrying out to right
field. Each fellow took his turn at bat. Boys like
Delvin, Larke and Gibbs—standing up like veterans
and cracking the hits out in fine shape, giving
a little more running practice to some of the
youngsters who had been sent out to the field to
chase the balls.</p>

<p>Finally it came Hagner’s turn. He stepped up to
the plate and stood there rather slouchily and loosely,
far away from the mark as if he were afraid of
the ball.</p>

<p>“Better step up a little closer,” said Hughie, “he
won’t hit you.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Hagner, “I want to learn all
about it.”</p>

<p>Miner served up one to him straight as an arrow.
<a href="#image06">Hagner swung hard</a> at it <a href="#image06">and missed.</a> He felt a bit
surprised himself. The next one he fouled off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
bat near his hands. Just as Miner sent up the third
ball Hagner stepped back from the plate, swung the
bat easily, met it squarely and crack went the ball in
a white streak clean over the center field fence!</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_39">“Hagner swung hard and missed.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>Miner looked at him surprised and said, “You
can’t do that again.”</p>

<p>The next time Hagner came up, Miner decided
to use some curves and make him earn his hit. He
sent up what looked like a fast straight ball about
waist high. Hagner swung on it and missed. The
ball had a terrific out curve and, of course, Hagner
understood they were only to be straight. He eyed
Miner closely and when he started to pitch Hagner
stooped over to watch the ball like a hawk. On came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the ball, starting wide of the plate and Hagner first
decided it was a ball and then as the inshoot started
in toward the plate, quick as a wink Hagner swung
his bat and over the fence she went again.</p>

<p>The fellows went wild. Hughie and Everson
standing back of the batting cage looked at each
other. “What do you know about that?” asked
Everson.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything,” said Hughie. “For a
big awkward fellow, he seems to be about the quickest
thing I ever saw. Why! he didn’t even look
ready to hit at that ball until it started to shoot in
toward the plate, and I was sure he was going to let
it go by. If he can bat like that regularly, we’ll
play him some place if he fumbles every ball that is
batted to him.”</p>

<p>Pretty soon Hughie asked, “Haven’t we got another
left-hander here?”</p>

<p>“There ought to be,” said Everson, looking
around. “Here, Case, get out there and show what
you can do. This is your chance.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Case in his polite way. “I’ll
try if you want me to.” He walked into the box
and picked up the ball where Miner had dropped it.
He had not really tried to pitch since last summer
and was a little nervous. The first ball went a little
bit wide. The second one nearly hit the batter.
The line of waiting batters grinned.</p>

<p>“Southpaws are either very good or very bad,”
said Captain Larke to Delvin. After he had thrown
a dozen balls or so, however, Case’s arm got in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
working order and only an occasional ball went wide
of the plate.</p>

<p>“He seems to be pretty good on the straight
ones,” said Jenkins. “If he can do as well when
we let them begin to try the curves, I think we can
put him on as a substitute.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of the bunch in general?”
asked Everson.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Hughie, “I think I can see a team
out of this crowd all right, though I am not quite
sure of Dill at first base. This fellow Robb seems
to be a fine batter and so does Talkington. Coach
Young says there was one of the young pitchers that
looked good, too—young Radams. If this Hagner
knows as much about any position as he seems to
about batting, I think I’ll let him choose his position.
Think of trying to tell him how to stand up to the
plate. He’s just a natural ball player. Don’t believe
he knows himself how he hits them. Black
told me, after he came out of the box, that he did
his best to fool Hagner every time after that first
time up, and you know how he succeeded. We’ll
know more when we get them out on the diamond
in the various positions.”</p>

<p>By this time the sun was sinking and it was too
dark for further practice. Hagner and Case walked
over to the clubhouse together.</p>

<p>“You sure made a hit with the crowd to-day, Hagner,”
said Case.</p>

<p>“I made five hits with my bat,” said Hagner,
“two of them over the fence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Guess you will make the team all right,” remarked
Case. “I heard Jenkins say, any fellow
who can bat like that can take his pick of positions
and play any one he likes.”</p>

<p>“Good. I’ll play shortstop if they give a choice.”</p>

<p>“Wish I had made as big a hit as you,” said Case.</p>

<p>“You did, because I heard Everson and Jenkins
talking it over, too; and they said you had excellent
control, and if you did well with the curves they
could carry you with the team. If I were you, however,
I’d learn to play some position, and make your
way as a utility player. You see, left-handed pitchers
are all right, but with a regular pitcher like this
Miner Black here, you wouldn’t often get a chance
to pitch more than an inning or two, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Case, “how good this Miner
Black is, but I think I can beat him to the regular
pitching job.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Hagner, “but if you don’t have
any more luck at ousting him than most of the fellows
have had hitting him, you’ll be out of a regular
job on the team for a long time. I’d practice playing
the first bag. Still think you’d make a first baseman.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” said Case, as they entered the
dressing room to change their clothes, “besides
either Dill or Ross seems sure to land the job.”</p>

<p>The second week of out-door practice the regular
work of the boys was increased. At batting practice
every fellow was expected to run clear around the
bases after he made his hit. The coaches and managers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
got a line on the base-running ability of the
boys in this way. Hagner, Robb, Case and Talkington
all showed up well in this direction.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the week the fellows were
lined up on the diamond at their regular positions,
the coaches trying out the various candidates for the
fielding jobs. Hughie batted grounders to the infield,
to each of them in turn.</p>

<p>After each play the ball was thrown from base
to base in all of the different combinations necessary
to all the imaginary situations, from short to first it
went, from first to third, from third home, and from
there to second, a white streak, the speed of the
players increasing daily as the men got surer of their
positions.</p>

<p>Others were batting flies to the outfield and the
coaches were moving about watching the work of
each man as he was tried in the different positions.
Each of the fielders was given a variety of work, at
bunting and the fielding of bunts, catching high infield
flies, picking up sizzling grounders, etc. This
work enabled Hughie to pick out his first line-up
for the first and second squads.</p>

<p>By the middle of March the two squads were
playing practice games among themselves.</p>

<p>The first squad generally lined up as follows:</p>

<p>Harold Case was a sort of substitute pitcher for
both squads. He would relieve Black for a while
for the first squad and Radams for the other squad,
so that both teams got plenty of practice in batting
a left-hand pitcher. There was no way for him to
find out in advance what Jenkins thought of him,
but he had high hopes of making the team, and he
felt absolutely confident that if he ever got a chance
in one of the full regular games, he would be able
to make good. Crossley also was given a good deal
of work during these practice games, as he gave
promise of doing well and it began to look as though
the choice for left-hand pitchers would be between
these two.</p>

<small>PICKING THE VARSITY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>On the 21st day of March as Harold with the
other members of the squads was in the dressing
room after practice, the head coach came into the
room with a slip of paper in his hand which he posted
on the Bulletin Board. There was a rush to read
the notice as soon as the coach had departed, and
several faces, as they turned away, wore a look of
disappointment, while others seemed proud and
happy.</p>

<p>Hagner and Case finally finished dressing and
turned to the board to read the bulletin before going
out. This is what they read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Varsity Training Table</span>—The training table
will start in the morning at Prettyman’s and the following
men for the first squad will report there for
breakfast—Everson, Delvin, Larke, Gibbs, Black,
Hagner, Robb, Talkington, Dill, Case, Radams,
Ross and Huyler. About the first of next month
the list may be increased or changed. Breakfast at
eight o’clock sharp. Members are required to be
on time.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Hugh Jenkins</span>, <i>Manager</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>“Guess I’ll get a chance to pitch after all,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Harold. It was a great day for him and he was
highly elated. The 19— Varsity had begun to take
definite shape, and being named on it meant recognition
by the great student body as possessing something
worth while in the line of ability. The news
spread rapidly through the University and wherever
the boys who had been named went they were treated
with honor and respect.</p>

<p>Breakfast the first morning at the training table
was a good deal of a get-together, get-acquainted
affair. I do not know what it is that makes the choice
of nicknames or how it is that it comes easier to
know some fellows by either their first or last names,
others by an abbreviation of one or the other, and
still others by adoption of something entirely different,
but when boys get to a certain stage of acquaintance
with each other there comes a spontaneous desire
to bestow a nickname and these names generally fit
in a remarkable way. Harold Case went to breakfast
known as Case and came out to be forever known
to Lowell men as Hal.</p>

<p>John Hagner started to drink his coffee that morning
as Hagner and when he had folded his napkin he
was known as both Hans and Honus, why nobody
ever could tell, and the names stuck to him for life.</p>

<p>Charles Radams came away with the nickname
Babe and as Babe he went down into the Lowell
Book of Heroes.</p>

<p>Everson had always been Everson before. He
was Everson when he sat down to the table that morning,
and he was still Everson when he left the room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
though why this little brainy Crab should have
gotten off without a nickname is far beyond me.</p>

<p>You would think that Larke, who was always jolly,
either whistling or singing when not eating or asleep,
would have been named The Lark years before, but
no, they called him just Cap., yet they had always
called Gibbs, Gibbie.</p>

<p>If there were a regular rule for nicknames they
would undoubtedly have called Black, White, but
they always referred to him as Miner. Delvin they
generally called Arthur.</p>

<p>There was something stiff about Dill which was a
good deal like the way he played first base in the
few games he lasted on the Varsity that year, and the
dispenser of nicknames overlooked him entirely at
that first breakfast. In fact, he never did acquire
one, for he was dropped from the team before anyone
could really find a good name to fit him. Pickle
would have been a good name for him, and also
his fate so far as the team was concerned.</p>

<p>Talkington was a quiet young chap, who said very
little either at the table or on the field, so that
“Talkie” or “Mr. Speaker,” or anything like that
wouldn’t seem natural at all, so they called him
“Tris” and let it go at that.</p>

<p>Robb might really have been given a fitting name
at the end of the season. If they had waited until
then they would undoubtedly have called him Robb
because he had developed into the greatest base
stealer the game ever knew, but somebody had
passed him the oatmeal that morning, after he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
demanded it vigorously, with a “Here you are, Tyrant,”
and Ty he is to-day—a very short name for so
long a fellow.</p>

<p>A week later they played the first real game of
the season, the first real test of the line-up as it had
been worked out by Jenkins. The game, which was
with Colfax, a small neighboring college, was not an
important one. Never had they been able to beat
Lowell and rarely in all the games that had taken
place between the two teams had Lowell been even
scored upon. As it was, it was hardly even a test
game for the Varsity. Hal sat on the players’ bench
with his chin on his hands, and watched the Colfax
boys getting licked.</p>

<p>There wasn’t anything very exciting about sitting
on the bench and there was nothing very encouraging
about the playing of even the Lowell boys. With
the exception of a hair-raising one-handed stop by
Hagner of a fast grounder over second, and a wonderfully
accurate throw to first without getting into
position, and the fine work of Gibbie behind the bat
in stopping Babe Radams’ wild drops and curves
which the Colfax boys struck at blindly, the game
was dull and uninteresting.</p>

<p>If the Colfax team had not had the usual attack
of stage fright that struck it whenever it played
Lowell, it probably would have won. Dill on first
dropped three throws in succession made by Everson
to catch runners at first, and if it had not been for
the accurate throwing of Gibbie to Delvin and Everson
who nipped all base runners as they tried to reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
second and third, there is no knowing but that the
Colfax team might have scored, to say nothing of
the possibility of winning. Hagner had fumbled an
easy grounder, only to make a jumping catch of a
high liner from the bat of the next man, which he
promptly threw to first completing a double as Dill
did not miss that one.</p>

<p><a href="#image07">Ty</a> in right field had <a href="#image07">misjudged the only chance
he had</a> but had recovered the ball in time to catch his
man at third with a quick throw and Delvin at the
bag to receive it.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 438px;">
<a name="image07" id="image07">
  <img src="images/image07.jpg" width="438" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_50">“Ty misjudged the only chance he had.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>By the end of the seventh inning the score stood
8 to 0 in favor of Lowell in spite of the poor
playing. The Varsity had batted well, nearly every
one had made hits, Everson had 1; Honus, 2; Delvin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
1; Ty, 2; Tris, 2; Cap., 1; Gibbie, 1; Dill, 1; and
even Babe Radams had dropped a Texas Leaguer
over second. Hal had sat on the bench all the time
with Ross and Miner and some of the second squad.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the eighth, Jenkins turned to
Ross and said: “You cover the first bag,” and then
to Hal, “Go on in the box for a little real practice,
Hal.” “That’s all right, Babe,” noticing a look
of disappointment on Radams’ face. “You are doing
fine, but you can’t have all the practice.”</p>

<p>“Remember, Hal,” he called from the bench,
“let them hit it, but we can’t have any scoring
against us.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Hal, as he picked up the ball.</p>

<p>The first man up hit the first ball pitched for a
base. The second batter laid down a neat bunt
along the first base line. Ross, the first baseman,
came in for it, and Hal hustled over to cover the
bag. Meantime the batter who was fast man, was
tearing down the base line like mad. Ross made a
good pick-up and turned to throw.</p>

<p>By that time the batter was only a few feet from
the bag where Hal was to receive the throw. Ross
had to throw quick and in doing so threw the ball
at Hal’s feet. Hal reached down, made a neat pick-up,
and the umpire waved the runner out.</p>

<p>There was now one out with a man on second.
The third batter hit a hard one at Everson, who retired
the runner at first, the man on second reaching
third. The next batter hit a slow bounder between
the box and first. Hal started after the ball, grabbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
it on the bounce with one hand and without stopping
raced to first base, which he reached just ahead of the
runner, making the third out.</p>

<p>As he walked to the bench Jenkins came up to
meet him and patting him on the back, said: “Good
boy, Hal,” which was fine, Hal thought.</p>

<p>It was his turn at bat, and he walked to the plate
with high hopes of making at least a two bagger.
The first ball looked like a straight one so Hal took
a good swing at it and missed. “That’s all right,”
called Hughie from the coaching lines, “there will
be two more better ones coming over directly.” The
next was a ball. The third was a slow one, and as
Hal noticed the left-fielder playing pretty far out he
thought he would just tap it for a nice little short
fly back of third. He thought of this as the ball was
coming toward him from the pitcher’s hands. He
whirled his bat with a short, quick swing and—thud—he
heard the ball strike the catcher’s
mitt.</p>

<p>“Well,” he heard Hughie calling him, “you only
need one to hit it, and you got one left.” The next
two balls he fouled off. The next two the umpire
called balls and it was two strikes and three balls.
Hal set himself for the last one. It was now or
never. Here was probably his only chance to-day to
make a hit and he might not get into another game
for weeks and show what he could do with his bat.
Slowly the pitcher started to wind up. Hal watched
every move. Here it came waist high and straight.
Now watch it. He swung at it hard. He heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
first—a tick, then a thud. He had made a foul tip
and the ball had struck in the catcher’s mitt.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he heard Hughie saying, “we
don’t expect pitchers to hit ’em anyhow.” But Hal
was disappointed and sore as he walked to the bench.
The next two men were retired on infield hits, and as
Hal walked to the box to pitch the first half of the
ninth inning he was nervous and mad at himself.</p>

<p>The result was he served up four bad balls in
succession and there was a man on first. The next
up hit the first ball right at Ross who was hugging
the base and he booted it. Hal was over on first bag
in a jump but Ross got the ball to him too late to
earn an assist and there were two men on and nobody
out. The crowd began to yell, “Take him
out.” “Where’s Miner?” but Jenkins paid no attention.
Many a pitcher had given a base on balls,
and Hal was not responsible for the second man.</p>

<p>He got ready to pitch as he faced the batter; he
somehow felt the man was going to bunt. As he delivered
the ball he started toward the plate on the
run, following the ball in. The batter bunted.
Hal was almost on top of him. <a href="#image08">He</a> reached out,
<a href="#image08">caught the ball</a> off the bat <a href="#image08">before it had reached the
ground</a>, thus making a caught fly out of what would
have been a perfect bunt, whirled around and fired
the ball to Everson at second, who nearly missed it
because the play was almost too quick for him, thus
completing a remarkable double play.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 424px;">
<a name="image08" id="image08">
  <img src="images/image08.jpg" width="424" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_53">“He caught it before it hit the ground.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>The crowd cheered. He heard them saying: “Oh!
You! Hal! Good boy! You needn’t take him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
out!” and he felt so good he went back into the box
and struck out the next batter and the game was over.
Then there was the usual rush to get the sweaters,
and the fans and players hustling to get off the field
as fast as they could together—the fans to get home
to dinner and the players to the shower baths and rub-downs.</p>

<p>Hal hustled along with the rest. On the way he
caught up with and passed Jenkins and Everson, together
as usual. They did not see him, but he heard
Jenkins say: “He looks more like a fielder than a
pitcher,” and he thought they meant him. Later,
as he walked along to his boarding house with Hans,
they talked about the game, and the part each of
them had taken in it, and Hans said, “I think you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
would make a good first baseman,” but Hal, who
thought he had come out of his pitching test pretty
well said, “But you see they don’t need a first baseman
(they all have their bad days like Dill and
Ross to-day), and they may need a good pitcher
any time.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>HAL AND CROSSLEY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There were quite a number of disappointed candidates
the day the Varsity list was posted. The
disappointment was felt most by the boys who had
an idea that they were the real thing as pitchers. A
pitcher can rarely do anything but pitch, and a large
percentage of boys who think they have the pitching
ability do not make good when put to the real test.
And so when they picked out the candidates for the
Varsity that year, a great number of fellows who had
high hopes missed even the second squad and finally
landed on the freshman team.</p>

<p>Among the fellows who had hopes of making the
team was Edward Crossley. He had reported as a
pitcher and had been given a good many try-outs in
the batting practice, and at first Hughie was attracted
by his work and had one or two talks with
him about his experience. Hughie’s first impression
was that Crossley could be developed into a substitute
or extra pitcher as he was strong and could throw a
swift ball. He also seemed to be able to serve up
curves fairly well. But Hughie had to change his
mind about Crossley. He was too erratic.</p>

<p>The trouble with Crossley was that he was a
spoiled son of a very rich man. He had the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
luxurious rooms of any of the fellows at Lowell.
He had a servant and an automobile. He had lots
of money to spend and he didn’t hesitate to “blow
it” as the boys say. He was a good fellow with
the boys whom he chose to make his friends and he
liked and was liked by those with whom he came in
contact as long as no one tried to do things different
from the way he wanted them done.</p>

<p>Crossley had been brought up to think that every
thing he wanted he could have. The fault was
largely with his parents. They gave him everything
he asked for and denied him nothing. Once in
a while his parents would try to curb his desire for
one thing or another, and then Crossley would pout
and his parents gave in.</p>

<p>This gave Crossley a very wrong idea of the
world in general. But he was to find that there were
other people in the world besides himself and that
they had ideas of their own and that many of them
were just as selfish in their ideas as he was. When
he met this kind of a fellow he got furiously angry.</p>

<p>When he came to Lowell he naturally thought
that the son of so wealthy a man as his father would
receive special attention by the college people and
students. When he found out that merit alone
counted in Lowell affairs, he was furious. When
he saw some fellow who could do some one thing
better than he could and who, therefore, received
the attention which his accomplishment warranted,
he became very jealous.</p>

<p>When he wanted anything that came to him as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
desire, he would stop at nothing in his efforts to
get it, by hook or crook.</p>

<p>The result of it all was that after he had been at
college for a few months he had not done anything
worth while for himself, and outside of a small number
of fellows who were brought up like himself he
had not made many friends who would do him any
good.</p>

<p>One of the things he asked his father for in the
early spring was a new automobile. His father would
just as soon have sent it as not, but he had been
reading something about other boys doing wonderful
things in football at college, and he was disappointed
that his son wasn’t in it. So he had what to him
was a brilliant idea, and he wrote his son that he
would present him with a new $15,000 imported car
the day he was named for the Varsity. This looked
easy to Crossley.</p>

<p>At home, Crossley, the rich man’s son, had bought
the suits for the High School nine. His father had
fixed up a fine ball park for the boys to play in and
he had done all this because his son had asked him
to and because he had insisted upon it.</p>

<p>Of course, Crossley had a right, under the circumstances,
to say which position on the team he would
play, and he had promptly selected the job as pitcher.
At first he was no good at all, but he hired a professional
player to teach him and at the end of the year
he had developed into a pretty good pitcher. In
fact, he might easily have become a first-class flinger
if his habits had been steady. Crossley had come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Lowell from White College, a little school in the
West, and he had been the pitcher for the team there.</p>

<p>When Hughie first began to take notice of Crossley
he couldn’t understand how a fellow could do so
well one day and so poorly another. It puzzled
him a good deal. He finally wrote to a friend who
was coach at White College and from him he found
out what the trouble was. Crossley had been a
good pitcher for White. As good as they ever had,
but he would not observe the training rules and he
would smoke cigarettes and take an occasional drink.
This made him erratic and unreliable at times.</p>

<p>Furthermore, he had a terribly jealous disposition
and bad temper and couldn’t stand it to have anybody
but himself praised when he was around.
Hughie’s friend doubted very much if Crossley
would be of any real service at Lowell, especially if
he continued his habits there as at White.</p>

<p>Hughie read this with a good deal of interest but
Crossley had shown up pretty well in practice and
Jenkins was inclined to think that the boy might have
gotten over his childishness since, being at Lowell.
So Hughie decided to reserve his judgment.</p>

<p>When the first Varsity list was made up a few
days later, Hughie and the coaches had finally to
decide between Crossley and Hal as left-hand
pitchers. They both showed up about the same in
the box and the decision was finally made in Hal’s
favor. So his name went on the list and Crossley
was sent to the second squad.</p>

<p>Now Crossley had wanted this automobile very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
much and he was disappointed. He felt that Case
had beat him out of the position. He became furiously
jealous and made a resolution that he would
“get” Hal in one way or another. What the way
was he himself did not know, but he had a cunning
mind and he decided to lay some deep plans to
undermine Hal, and then he would get the job and
the auto.</p>

<p>A day or two after the Colfax game, the two
squads were lined up for general practice. The
practice was principally devoted to batting and base
running. One squad would take the field lined up in
the regular positions, and the other at bat. Each
batter remained at the plate until he got a hit. Then
he ran to first of course. From there he was expected
to steal his way round the bases.</p>

<p>Of course it is hard to steal a base when the other
side knows what you are going to do, but stealing
bases is a very important part of the game. Everson
was on the lines helping Hughie instructing on
base stealing. And squad No. 2 was at bat. Hal
had been asked to see what he could do at the second
bag. A few minutes afterward Crossley came up
for his turn at bat, and made a hit and went to first.
Then Hughie, who was on the coaching line back of
first, told him to steal on the next ball pitched.
Crossley was a good runner and Hal was not used
to the position. He had stuck to the bag the way
first basemen do, to receive the throw from the
catcher. The catcher threw quickly to Hal who had
the ball in his hand waiting for Crossley when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
latter was still fifteen feet from the base. The natural
thing for Crossley to have done was to slide.
Instead he came the rest of the way standing up, and
when he was five feet from the bag he gave a jump
for the bag, and landed with both feet, spikes and
all, on Hal’s right foot, cutting him badly, and knocking
him down. They both rolled over in the dirt,
and Hal had to be picked up and carried from
the field.</p>

<p>Hughie and Everson had hold of Crossley and
were calling him various kinds of names for such
bone-headed conduct—for once in their lives both
of these boys had been fooled—they thought what
they had seen was Crossley’s idea of stealing a base
and were wondering where he got such an idea.</p>

<p>Hal himself as he was carried from the field by
Hans, thought it was his own fault standing on
second base as he did with the ball in his hands,
instead of running up the line out of the path of the
runner and touching him out before he got to the bag.</p>

<p>Hal blamed no one but himself, but Hans, while
he said nothing, had seen the look in Crossley’s eye
as he started for second, and had watched him all the
way. He had noted particularly the viciousness of
Crossley’s jump and the care with which he brought
his feet down on the right spot and while he knew
of no reason why Crossley should have it in for Hal,
he knew there was something back of it. Hal’s foot
was pretty badly cut, but the doctor fixed him up,
sent him home in a carriage and told him he’d better
not put his uniform on for three or four days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#image09">He was out next day with a cane</a>, and his foot
did not hurt him particularly. He went to the ball
grounds and watched the boys practice and he got to
thinking that he hadn’t counted on being injured.
He had been spiked before, however, and he felt
that with proper care he would be back in the game
again soon, and not knowing that he had an enemy,
he had no reason for not feeling good.</p>

<p>Hal, in fact, was feeling very good about this
time. The winter’s cold had given way to the rare
warmth of the Eastern spring. The grass was green,
the trees were in leaf, the sun was just right—not
too warm—like his own balmy California. He was
making friends among the students, his prospects of
getting into some of the big games were very good—he
was happy. He had a good chum in Hagner,
whose more extended experience with the hard
knocks of the world had made him wise for his age,
and he was a good adviser for Hal.</p>

<p>You see Hagner had worked for everything he
had gotten in the world. He couldn’t remember
when he didn’t work. When he was going to Grammar
School he sold papers at night and Saturdays.
In the mornings he had to get up early and deliver
milk to the few people who could be induced to
patronize the Hagner dairy which consisted of two
cows only—and whose entire output didn’t warrant
a wagon or bottles—so Hans delivered the milk in
tin pails.</p>

<p>One summer he worked in a barber shop, because
that was the only thing that he could find to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
around the little town where he lived. When he
got into High School he gave up the milk and paper
business to a younger brother and spent his time
clerking in a grocery store every evening and on Saturdays,
and made enough money that way, so that his
parents were content to let him follow out his ambition
to secure an education.</p>

<p>On Sundays he played baseball when it was baseball
weather and in Texas where he lived it was that
kind of weather nearly all the year round. That’s
where he learned to like the game and also where he
learned the first principles of it. After he had been
graduated from the High School he went to Wahoo
College, which was only fifty miles from his home.</p>

<p>It was a little more than a preparatory institution,
although the course of study was broad enough so
that a graduate from there could enter Lowell without
further examination. The summer before going
to Wahoo College Hagner had sold books—was
a real book agent—and he made enough money in
the three months to keep him at college for a year.
The expenses at Wahoo were not large, and there
was something left over for his folks. This he did
every year while at Wahoo, so that he was able to
give all of his time at school to his studies, and baseball.
He learned to love the game as nothing else
in the world. He found he had a certain naturalness
which few boys possess. He seemed instinctively to
do the right thing at the right time, and this developed
a great deal of confidence in himself. His greatest
ambition was to have a fine education, but as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
small boy it didn’t look as though that would ever
come. But little by little, as he did the things he
had to do, he found he was getting there.</p>

<p>He had gone through High School and made his
own way, and at Wahoo College he still made his
own way, getting stronger and more confidence in
himself every day. He stood well in his studies and
he got his good marks by hard work and constant
application.</p>

<p>On the little college team Hans was quite a wonder.
What ability he displayed there he thought
was all natural.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact he studied the game of baseball
as hard as he did his Cæsar. He developed
a lot of ability as a batter but he got it by studying
how to hold his bat, how to stand up at the plate,
by watching every movement of the pitcher, and keeping
his eye on the ball all the time and by learning
not to be afraid of being hit.</p>

<p>So by the time he had arrived at Lowell he had a
lot of confidence in himself. He knew he could
get out at any time and make a living as a salesman.
His confidence and earnestness were a great help to
him in that line, as they were in everything, and
Hagner had gotten to the point, even though only
twenty-four, where he was absolutely sure of himself,
and he didn’t have to worry about anything but how
to make the most of his time at the University—how
to get the most out of his studies and how to have
the most fun as time offered.</p>

<p>For this reason he was a good deal of help to Hal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
who had never had to hustle for himself, although,
as he knew, his folks had pinched and saved in order
to give him this first year at Lowell. His folks had
been sending him the funds he absolutely needed
every month, with a little pocket money besides,
which Hal spent carefully. He was getting into
the habit of being economical and Hagner’s self-reliance
and confidence spurred him on.</p>

<p>They would talk these things over among themselves
often. Hal knew that if he was to be at
Lowell the next year he would have to rely on his
folks again or else win one of those scholarships.</p>

<p>“Better work for the Scholarship,” said Hans.
“It don’t pay to owe anybody, even if it is your
own folks. From what I have learned it is pretty
hard for them to send you this money every month,
anyhow. I don’t think I would have worked nearly
so hard at school if I had been spending some one
else’s money. It hasn’t been easy work for me to sell
books every summer, but I’ve done it. I don’t like
the work very well, and now that this chance of a
scholarship is in sight, I am going to work my toes
off if necessary, to land one of them; I think I’ll get
it, too, if I don’t break my leg or something.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fine thing for you, of course,” responded
Hal, “because you have a regular position
on the team right now, and there’s no one to take it
away from you, while I am only a substitute pitcher
and general utility man, who probably won’t get a
chance to play in any of the big games at all.”</p>

<p>It was plain that Hal became discouraged from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the talk. But he felt absolutely certain that he could
jump in and take the laurels away from any pitcher
they had, if he could only get in enough games to
get accustomed to the big crowds and the surroundings.
But the season was coming along and Black
and Radams were doing the twirling and doing it
well, too.</p>

<p>Then, unexpectedly, one morning there came a letter
from home that Hal’s father had been taken sick
and they had to use a little of the money from Hal’s
college fund to tide them over and Hal would have
to get along with about half his allowance for a
month, anyhow.</p>

<p>This was a shock to Hal. Not so much the money
part, but his father’s sickness. He hated to think
of his father being sick and he not at home. Then
he thought of the money, and his first idea was to
get on a train for California. Yes! That’s what
he would have to do. He couldn’t think of staying
at Lowell any longer, spending his father’s hard-earned
money. What he ought to be doing was
what Hans had done. He should learn how to earn
money and when he had done that, get his education.</p>

<p>He felt this was a decision that should be acted on
at once. He decided to pack up right away. He
didn’t stop to think he didn’t have anything like the
amount necessary to pay his fare home. Hans wasn’t
in his room and wasn’t to be back until three o’clock,
so he thought in his excitement that he would pack
hurriedly and get out without seeing anybody. He
did so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>He wasn’t going to be dependent on his folks or
anyone else for another day. He left a note for
Hans. This was at noon. He hunted up a time
table and found that the train for Boston to catch
the through train for the West left at three o’clock.
He would buy his ticket and go. He had no
thought of changing his mind. He went to the
depot to get his ticket. All at once, he realized that
he hadn’t any money. What was he to do now?
It was one o’clock already. Hal’s mind worked
quickly. How could he get two hundred dollars?
Quickly he ran over in his mind the things he had
that he might raise some money on. There was only
one thing that was worth anything like that sum.
At first he couldn’t think of parting with that. It
was his watch.</p>

<p>He had never told the story of the watch in Lowell
to anyone but Hans. The previous winter while
swimming in the lake at home in California, a rowboat
in which there had been a man and two little
girls, was suddenly capsized. Hal was a regular
“fish” in the water, just as natural there as in anything
that he understood at all, and he swam to the
rescue. He caught one of the little girls and held her
up with one hand while he righted the boat, and he
then put her in.</p>

<p>By that time the man, who was the father of the
little girls, had the other one safe, but he was a big
man and fat and couldn’t swim very well, so Hal
helped them both into the boat again, jumped in
himself and rowed them back to the shore near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
hotel where they were stopping. They were tourists
from the East and wanted to reward Hal, but
he didn’t think he had done anything so great, so
he ran away. That was the last Hal heard of it,
until a month later a package came by express addressed
to him. He opened it and found a letter
and a very fine gold watch with two large diamonds
in the case.</p>

<p>The letter was from the father of the two little
girls. He said he had found out who Hal was and
begged him to accept the watch in token of the
sender’s gratitude for the rescue of the little girls.
They were twins and exactly alike—so were the diamonds
in the case. Hal hardly ever wore the watch
and so very few knew he had it. Now he decided
to pawn it if he could borrow enough on it to get
to California.</p>

<p>He had never been in a pawnshop in his life and
he was nervous. Besides, his time was getting short.
He rushed out of the station and asked the first person
he met (it was Crossley, although in his excitement
Hal couldn’t have told whether the man was
black or white) where there was a pawnshop. Crossley
didn’t answer, because Hal hadn’t stopped for
an answer and Crossley himself was hurrying. He
was already talking to the policeman on the corner.
The policeman told Hal there was a pawnshop in
the other end of town, but that most of the students
who had to raise money that way went to Boston.
Hal started out to the pawnshop the policeman told
him about, but when he got there he found it closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>By the time Hal got back to the station it was five
minutes of three. He had decided to go into Boston
and try to raise the money there on the watch; then
he would go right on home from here. He checked
his trunk, and just then the train drew into the station
and he got aboard.</p>

<p>Meantime Hans had arrived back at the house
thirty minutes before he was expected. He straightened
things around in his room, put his books away
and after a minute or two found Hal’s note. The
note just said that he had bad news from home, his
father was sick, and they couldn’t send him his allowance.
He was going. He was sorry he couldn’t
see Hans again, but he was discouraged and said he
would write. Would Hans tell Hughie the circumstances,
etc.? He was leaving Boston on the afternoon
train.</p>

<p>Hans knew the train left at three. He pulled out
his watch and saw it was fifteen minutes of three. It
took sixteen minutes to get to the station on the car.
The train might be on time.</p>

<p>The note hadn’t sounded quite right to Hans.
Hal ought not leave the University without first registering
out at the office of the college. He thought
there might be something else. Above all he didn’t
want Hal to go to California without seeing him
again. He was very fond of his chum. He thought
of these things as he was gliding down the front
steps. To catch that train he would have to beat the
car. That meant to do it on foot.</p>

<p>Hans started to run. <a href="#image10">Every block</a> put behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
him <a href="#image10">was like a stolen base to him</a>. By running
every block he managed to catch the last car of the
train just as she pulled out. There he stopped long
enough to catch his breath for he knew they couldn’t
get off now since it was an express to Boston without
stop.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 419px;">
<a name="image10" id="image10">
  <img src="images/image10.jpg" width="419" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_70">Every block was like a stolen base to Hans.</a></div>
</div>

<p>Hans walked into the car. His first glance
showed him a blue hat and suit that looked like
Hal’s, and as he came up to the seat he was just
about to slap him on the back with a “Hello! Hal!”
when he saw the fellow had on blue glasses. He
stopped, then saw that the face wasn’t Hal’s and went
on through the train, glad that he hadn’t slapped
a stranger’s back in his best college style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Up in the car next to the smoker he found Hal.
He was sitting by the window resting his chin on his
hands and in his hand he held the letter from his
mother which he was rereading.</p>

<p>“You look mighty glum for a fellow that’s going
home,” said Hans, tapping him gently on the shoulder.
“What’s up?”</p>

<p>Hal looked up in surprise at the familiar voice and
turned to look at Hans.</p>

<p>“Thought you were not going to be back until
three,” remarked Hal. “I am glad you got back
in time to catch the train, though, because I hated to
leave without bidding you good-by.”</p>

<p>“Had to run all the way to the station to catch it.
Thought I’d better see you before you left for good.
Would like to know the real reason. Don’t look
well to leave a college like Lowell without some explanation
to the office. What’s the trouble, anyhow?”
burst out Hans, in the short quick sentences
which he used when he was much interested.</p>

<p>“This,” said Hal, handing him the letter. Hans
read it over and then he read it again. “Awfully
sorry your father is sick, Hal,” he said, “but I don’t
see anything about wanting you to come home.
Why, this letter don’t even say that he is very sick.
Don’t see any reason for going home on that kind of
a letter.”</p>

<p>“Well, but don’t you see,” broke in Hal, “they
had to break into the college fund to pay the extra
bills and I must get along on less. I don’t mind that,
but this is the first time I knew that all my folks have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
saved up in all these years was to go for my start
in college, and when I think of a fellow like you,
Hans, who has made his own money and think that
I am here spending my parents’ savings, I can’t stand
it another minute, so I’m going home to learn how to
make enough to pay my own way through college.”</p>

<p>“And spoil your parents’ greatest happiness,” said
Hans. “Let me tell you something. My folks
were poorer than yours. They were so poor they
couldn’t think of educating their children. Their
greatest happiness was in work and seeing others
work with their hands. They couldn’t realize what
education would do. They had no way of realizing
it. Somehow or other I got the ambition to have
an education. In order to do that I had to earn
enough money to pay into the family what I could
have made working daytimes.</p>

<p>“This was only after I was old enough to work for
others. So I worked early in the morning and late
at night and made up to the folks the time I spent at
school. Now your parents know the value an education
will be to you. Your father is a Lowell graduate
and they have been saving this money for years
in order to spend it on your first year at Lowell, trusting
to luck that some way will be found to let you go
on. It’s been their one great happiness and they’d
probably feel mighty bad to see you turn up at home
without their sending for you.</p>

<p>“All you ought to be thinking of is how to get the
most out of it this year and get ready to make the
burden lighter for the next year. Winning one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the Scholarship Prizes would do it of course, but
there are other ways.”</p>

<p>“You put it up to me in a different way than I
had thought of it before,” said Hal. “If I thought
I could earn some money working nights, I think I’d
try it.”</p>

<p>“If you think that way about it, I’ll see what I
can do. We’ll go round to the employment department
of the University in the morning and see if
they haven’t something to do for a poor and needy
student to help him earn his way, especially one who
is utility pitcher on the Varsity. Meantime I guess
we had better send a telegram to your folks asking if
your father is better or worse. We can have an answer
by morning.”</p>

<p>“I think that would be a good idea,” said Hal,
very much cheered by his talk with Hans and his
suggestions. “Come to think of it, though, as you
say, if he was sick enough to make them want me,
they would telegraph, anyhow, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” said Hans. “Where did you expect
to get the money to get home on?”</p>

<p>And then Hal told him his idea about pawning
his watch, of his effort to do so before he started
for Boston, and that he had intended to do it in
Boston.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t do that ever until I had to,” remarked
Hans. “Anyway not to go home on. If
you can pawn it for enough to get to California on,
you can pawn it for enough to keep you going at
school for the rest of the term. I wouldn’t do it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
until I had to, though. It’s a bad practice to get
into, although I never was in a pawnshop in my life,
and hope I never have to go.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how much they would loan me on the
watch,” said Hal. “Suppose we try it and see when
we get to Boston. Just to see what it is worth,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Hans, and just then the brakeman
called out Boston and in a minute or two the
train stopped. Neither had ever been in Boston
before except to pass through on his way to the
University. They thought they might as well take
in a show in the evening and take the twelve o’clock
train back to the University, which would land them
there about two o’clock in the morning. They were
walking up to the platform to go out through the
depot when they met Arthur Delvin of the Varsity
going through the station.</p>

<p>“Hello, fellows,” said Arthur. “What are you
doing in the city? By George, I am glad to see you!
Want you to come up to the house for dinner and
then we’ll take in a show. Wait for me in the station,
will you? I have to go out and find a cousin
of mine who is coming in and going right away again,
and I have to see that she gets started right. She’s
on this train. I’ll see you in about fifteen minutes.”
And off he went.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but wait and the boys
decided that if they were going to see some of Boston,
Arthur would be as fine a fellow as any to show
them around, and they went into the station to wait.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Meantime Hal had been wondering what his
watch was really worth and as he walked to the
door of the station he saw a sign “Pawnbroker”
with three gold balls over the door. This was just
like the place he saw at the University town earlier
in the day, and looking around for Hans who was
sitting on a bench absorbed in a newspaper, he quietly
slipped across the street into the pawnbroker’s shop,
and pulling out his watch said to the pawnbroker:</p>

<p><a href="#image11">“How much will you loan me on this?”</a> He
wondered if that was the way people generally talked
when they tried to pawn things.</p>

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_76">“How much will you loan me on this?”</a></div>
</div>

<p>The man took the watch and looked at it carefully.
He examined the diamonds with a magnifying glass,
he opened the case and examined the works, then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
laid it down on the counter and said “Four hundred
and fifty dollars.”</p>

<p>Hal wondered if he had heard rightly. “How
much did you say?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Four hundred and fifty dollars,” answered the
man. “She’s worth a thousand.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Hal, picking up the watch and
putting it in his pocket. “I just wanted to know
how much it was worth.”</p>

<p>“Come in any time,” said the man, as Hal went
out of the door. Outside he drew a long breath,
took out his handkerchief to wipe the perspiration
from his forehead, and started across the street. <a href="#image12">As
he did so, a young fellow</a> who had been standing in
the shadow of the doorway <a href="#image12">stooped down and picked
up an envelope which had fallen out of Hal’s pocket</a>
when he took out his handkerchief, looked at it, gave
a start and went on down the street.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">
<a name="image12" id="image12">
  <img src="images/image12.jpg" width="380" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_77">“As he did so a young fellow stooped down and picked up an envelope which had
fallen out of Hal’s pocket.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>Hal went into the depot, and as he hadn’t been
gone five minutes in all, Hans hadn’t missed him.
Hal told him where he’d been, also what the pawnbroker
had said, and as he named the amount Hans’
eyes opened a good deal wider, for he had no idea
the watch was so valuable.</p>

<p>Presently Arthur came up and the boys told him
frankly how they happened to be in town, and asked
him to say nothing about it, which he agreed to, as
Hal had now decided to go back to school. Arthur
said he had come to town on the morning train to
do some shopping.</p>

<p>So they went home with Arthur, and having some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
one who was familiar with the city to pilot them, they
weren’t worried about that. Mr. and Mrs. Delvin
were glad to have a couple of Arthur’s team mates
to dinner, and they went to a vaudeville show, which
was a new experience for Hans. They enjoyed the
evening immensely and after a two-hour ride on the
train got home pretty tired, but none the worse for
the experience.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>THE DIAMOND MEDAL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There was plenty of excitement in and about
Lowell the morning after Hans and Hal returned
from Boston. In fact there had been a good deal
of excitement the evening before, but of this Hans
and Hal knew nothing. They were in Boston having
a good time with Delvin.</p>

<p>“What’s all the bustle about?” asked Hal as he
and Hans entered the dining room at training table
next morning.</p>

<p>“What! haven’t you heard?” asked Robb, to
whom more than anyone else Hal seemed to be talking.
“The diamond studded Championship Medal
was stolen from the safe of the University treasurer’s
office yesterday between twelve and one o’clock.
There is no clue of any kind. Orders are from the
faculty that every student in the University shall report
at the dean’s study before six o’clock to-night,
and explain his movements after twelve o’clock yesterday.
Seems funny that they should suspect any
student of doing it.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t there some one in the room where the
safe is all day yesterday?” asked Hal.</p>

<p>“What makes them think it was stolen between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
twelve and one o’clock? How do they know it
wasn’t stolen a week or a month ago?” asked Hans.</p>

<p>“It seems that the secretary of the University
brought it back from the jewelers at noon yesterday.
It had been taken there to have one of the settings
tightened. He had put it in the safe. A few
minutes after one o’clock, Mr. Williams, the treasurer,
came in and asked if the medal had come back
yet. ‘I just brought it over,’ said the secretary, and
walked over to the safe to get it. It wasn’t there
and he almost collapsed.</p>

<p>“They searched everywhere a dozen times. It
couldn’t be found. Finally they were forced to
conclude it had been stolen. <a href="#image13">Who could have taken
it?</a> No one but students had called at the office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
during that hour. It was hard to believe any student
could have taken it, but they had to admit the
possibility.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 482px;">
<a name="image13" id="image13">
  <img src="images/image13.jpg" width="482" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_80">“Who could have taken it?”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“The police were notified and asked if they had
seen any suspicious characters around the building.
The Chief instructed all the patrolmen in town to
bring in any suspicious characters.</p>

<p>“Finally late last night,” continued Robb, “the
policeman down at the station reported that shortly
after one o’clock yesterday a young fellow had asked
to be directed to a pawnshop. He was very much
excited and in a hurry. Might have been a student,
but he thought he was a stranger because most students
would know where the pawnshop was, even if
they didn’t have any business there.</p>

<p>“So they have this cop stationed down by the entrance
and he is looking at the students as they go in
thinking he can identify the fellow if he should happen
to be a student.”</p>

<p>“Seems silly to me,” remarked Hans, “that they
should think any student of Lowell who would do a
trick like that would be so bone-headed as to try to
pawn it in this town. I doubt if any pawnbroker in
the country would take a thing like that. It would
be recognized immediately.”</p>

<p>“He could take out the diamonds and melt it up,”
said Talkington, who had joined in the discussion.</p>

<p>Hal’s face was white. He knew they were looking
for him, thinking that he was the guilty party!
What should he do? He could account for all of
his time. He would tell them the exact facts, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
detail, even his visit to the pawnshop in Boston to find
out what his watch was worth. Hans was with him
all the time, excepting in the pawnshop, and so was
Delvin most of the time. The pawnbroker would
no doubt testify for him that he simply made an inquiry
there and pawned nothing.</p>

<p>After breakfast he said to Hagner with as much
self-control as he could muster, “Hans, I’m the fellow
they are after. When I was crazy to get away
yesterday for home, and was bent on pawning my
watch, I went up to that policeman at the station and
asked him where I could find a pawnshop.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” said Hans, “that looks bad, doesn’t it?
Yes! it looks bad, but only looks. You’re all right.
Wasn’t the pawnshop closed when you got there?
Isn’t it the only pawnshop in town? They can find
out that it was closed, can’t they? Wasn’t I with
you all the time in Boston and on the way there and
back? And wasn’t Delvin with us, too?”</p>

<p>“All but during my visit to the shop,” said Hal,
“when I learned the value of my watch.”</p>

<p>“Well,” returned Hans, “the pawnbroker will
know you if it comes to that, and can testify that you
didn’t leave anything there.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought,” said Hal. “I am going
right down there and tell the whole story. That
will let me out, except that I may have to make another
trip to Boston.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go along,” said Hans.</p>

<p>So they went on down. They didn’t see any policeman
around outside. Inside they found Mr. Williams,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the treasurer, who came to meet them. Hal
told him that they had heard the police were trying
to locate a fellow who had asked one of them to direct
him to a pawnshop yesterday. He was the fellow,
and he said he wanted to tell all about it, which he did.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams was impressed with the straightforwardness
of his story and told him he needn’t
worry about it. He felt sure it wasn’t any student
that had stolen the medal. Only they had to run
down this clew and he was sorry he had been annoyed.
Hal told him he would like some one to go
to the pawnbroker in Boston and verify what he
had said about his visit there just to remove any
possibility of suspicion that anyone might have against
him on that account. He knew, of course, it would
prove to be as he said, and that was the only space of
time he was alone while in Boston. Without doing
this, people might suspect that both Hans and himself,
having made such an unusual trip to Boston together
so soon after the robbery occurred, were in it
and he didn’t want anything left undone to prove
that neither of them was in any way connected with
the matter or subject to suspicion.</p>

<p>Hal left with Hans, very much relieved. Not
that he had anything to be worried over, but the way
the matter had come about had upset him more than
he himself could tell, and now that he had explained
himself fully, his feelings again became normal, and
he went about his work of the day in a much better
frame of mind than he had enjoyed since he had
the accident.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>UNDER SUSPICION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The theft of the medal was of course the all-absorbing
topic at all places where students came together.
Hal’s explanation of his intended flight and
the causes which made him want to know where the
pawnshop was, brought to an end the clew which the
authorities had thought would quickly locate the
thief. There seemed to be absolutely no way to
trace the culprit.</p>

<p>A week passed and Hal’s foot became better and
he was able to resume his practice with the team.</p>

<p>On Friday evening Hal was in his room doing his
studies, in order to have them out of the way, so that
he could enjoy himself fully on Saturday and Sunday,
without having to think of college work, when
he received a note from Mr. Williams, the treasurer
of the University, asking him if he could come down
for a few minutes. The note was delivered by a
blue-coated messenger boy. After reading it, he said
he would go and the messenger left.</p>

<p>Hal went into Hans’ room to tell where he was
going, found that he was not in his room and as
they had planned to do some studying together later
in the evening he started to write a note on the pad on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the writing desk. Then he thought Hans would
understand better what was up if he left the treasurer’s
note on Hans’ desk. He did this and went
on down to see Mr. Williams.</p>

<p>When he arrived there he found Mr. Williams,
Dr. Lawrence, the president, and Mr. Smith, the
secretary, waiting for him. There was nothing that
Hal need be nervous about, and he could think of
nothing they could want him for, unless perhaps they
wanted to “call him down” for leaving the University
without explanation.</p>

<p>On second thought he made up his mind that if
that were the idea, they surely wouldn’t have the
president of the University on hand. Then he
thought that perhaps the president wanted to hear
his story about the pawnshop, etc., and he wished
Hans were with him to verify it. All this passed
through his mind in the few seconds he had to wait
until they noticed his arrival.</p>

<p>“Oh, Case,” said Mr. Williams, “we have asked
you down here to-night to tell you some important
news. First, the medal has been found, and——”</p>

<p>“I am very glad it has turned up,” broke in Hal,
relieved, “and I appreciate your telling me in this
way, Mr. Williams, because I suppose you know I
have——”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is one reason, Case,” now broke in
Mr. Williams, “but there are certain circumstances
in connection with the finding of the medal, which I
regret to say will need a little further explanation
on your part.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, what do you mean?” asked Hal, growing
a little nervous at the tone used by Mr. Williams.</p>

<p>“I hope,” went on Mr. Williams, “that you have
an explanation which is satisfactory. I cannot quite
bring myself to believe, after the straightforward
talk you made to me last week, that you had anything
to do with the theft of the medal, but the circumstances
of recovery demand an explanation from you.
When you told me your story the other day you gave
me the address of the pawnshop in Boston where you
went to inquire about the value of your watch. You
were so frank about asking us to go there and verify
your story that I didn’t think it worth while to do so.</p>

<p>“Among the methods used, however, by us in our
efforts to recover the medal we asked the Boston police
to visit all the pawnshops and see what they
could find. This morning we had word by long
distance phone from Boston, saying the medal had
been found in one of the pawnshops there and suggesting
that we send some one in authority to bring
it back and to go over some facts in connection
with the case, which might aid them in locating
the culprit. I was going up anyhow and I said I
would attend to the matter myself. When I arrived
at police headquarters, the chief took me into
his private office. He went to his safe and when he
returned he handed me the medal which I now show
you (he held up the beautiful medal in his right
hand) and he also handed me this.” Then with his
left hand he picked up an envelope which was lying
on his desk and handed it to Hal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Hal was puzzled because he didn’t know what that
could have to do with him. He looked up and
noticed all three of the officers of the University
watching his face closely. He couldn’t understand it
and naturally became paler. It looked to him like a
trap. Then he reached over with his right hand and
took the envelope which Mr. Williams held out
for him.</p>

<p>He felt that something terrible was going to happen
and his hand shook. He took the envelope,
looked at it, turned it over, looked at the other side,
and gave a jump. What he saw would make most
young fellows jump even higher than Hal did, for
on the address side of the envelope was written</p>

<p class="right">“HAROLD CASE,            <br />
————        <br />
California.”</p>

<p>Hal noticed at once that it was his own writing.
It was some seconds before anyone in the room
spoke. To Hal it seemed hours. Finally, it was he
himself who broke the silence.</p>

<p>“Where did you get this?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The police found it with the medal in the shop
where it was pawned, and the broker said it was
handed to him by the fellow who pawned the medal.”
This was said slowly in order to give the others a
chance to notice what effect the words had on Hal.
“It looks something like your writing,” said Mr.
Williams.</p>

<p>“It is my handwriting,” said Hal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“How do you explain it?” asked Mr. Williams.</p>

<p>“I can’t explain it,” answered Hal. “I know
absolutely nothing about it.”</p>

<p>“The medal and this envelope,” went on Mr.
Williams, “were found in the pawnshop which you
said you had visited that night in Boston. After I
saw the Chief of Police and he gave me the medal
and the envelope he went with me to the pawnshop
and when I got there I recognized the address which
you had given me. Then we rode back to the police
department to interview the pawnbroker who has
been arrested for receiving stolen property, and he
told me this story.</p>

<p>“‘About five o’clock on Thursday evening of the
previous week, a young man wearing a blue cloth
hat and a mixed gray suit of clothes came into my
place and asked me how much I would loan him on
a watch which he laid down on the show case. I
picked it up and saw two good-sized diamonds in
the case. I was attracted by the stones and next
examined them with my magnifying glass. They
were exactly alike and I saw at once they were valuable,
particularly to me as I had been asked that day
by a customer to find him two perfectly matched
white stones.</p>

<p>“‘Then I examined the watch inside and out and
saw that it was also very valuable, and I said, thinking
to get the watch cheap, since most people who
pawn things do not redeem them, “I will let you
have four hundred and fifty dollars on it.” The
young fellow hesitated and then asked: “How much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
is it worth?” and I said, “a thousand dollars,” and
he said, hesitating again, “Thank you, I just wanted
to find out how much it is worth,” and hurried out.
I didn’t think any more of it, except to guess to myself
that the watch didn’t belong to the young man.
About five minutes later he came back and I said,
“Well, you have decided to let me have the watch
anyhow for a while haven’t you?” He looked at
me rather queerly and said after hesitating as he did
before, “No, I won’t pawn that.” I noticed then
he had on blue eyeglasses, but couldn’t say whether
he had them on the first time he called because I
paid more attention to the watch than to him.</p>

<p>“‘Finally he pulled out the medal, a very beautiful
piece, and said, “I can spare this better for a
while than the watch if you can let me have as much
on it.” I took it in my hand, and noticing the inscription
on it, said: “Is it yours?” “Of course,” he
replied, and as it might easily be so from the inscription,
and as very few people would take a chance on
trying to pawn that kind of a medal if it didn’t belong
to them, I took it and gave him four hundred and
fifty dollars and the ticket. “I may not be able to
come for this myself,” he said, “and I might lose
the ticket, so make a note that it is not to be delivered
to anyone, even if he has the ticket unless it is accompanied
by an envelope like this one with this
name on it and in his handwriting.” Then he handed
me the envelope which I put in the safe with the
medal, and which I turned over to the police this
morning.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Hal was dumfounded. What could he say? He
thought awfully hard. Finally he was able to say,
“But I was with Hagner or with Hagner and Delvin
all of the time I was in Boston, excepting during the
five minutes it took me to call at the pawnshop about
the watch. Besides, I haven’t any blue glasses. I
didn’t have any and wouldn’t have had time to buy
any while there.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you were only away from Hagner
for five minutes? The pawnbroker said both visits
took place within ten or fifteen minutes all told. The
glasses might have been bought before you took
the train. We are not trying to accuse you, Case,
we are trying to keep from having to,” said Mr.
Williams.</p>

<p>“I am not sure that it was exactly five minutes,”
said Hal. “I am not sure of anything except that I
had nothing to do with the theft of the medal. And
yet I can’t blame you gentlemen very much, because
it certainly does look bad, especially when I was on
my way to leave the University for good.”</p>

<p>Hal had somewhat recovered his balance because
he knew, of course, that it must come out all right
somehow, although he had no idea what or how
they were going to do him. He knew he was innocent
yet here were a lot of circumstances that
looked like evidence to them and until he could clear
them up he would be under great suspicion.</p>

<p>If they should decide that the evidence warranted
action they could even have him locked up, and he
began to think of the books he had read of people—men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
women, and boys who had been unjustly accused
of different crimes and had been locked up for years,
many of them never having their innocence proved.
It was a terrible fix for him. All this went through
his mind while the others were consulting.</p>

<p>Finally Dr. Lawrence, the president, turned to
Hal and said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Case, it is a terrible thing for all of us to
have to consider a matter of this kind. It is one of
the few occasions in my life when I would rather be
anyone else than the President of Lowell University.
Whoever it was who performed this theft may have
to answer finally for the conviction of an innocent
young man. We are loath to accuse you of this
crime. In fact, I wish you to understand thoroughly
that we do not accuse you now. At the same time
the circumstances are such that we cannot, we regret
to say, exonerate you until the matter is fully cleared
up. You yourself admit that it looks bad for you.
It does. But we will not permit ourselves to believe
you guilty until every effort has been made to clear
it up. Meantime, however, not as a punishment for
the matter, but to put it on a basis which while not
justifiable is nevertheless explainable, as the result
of your intention to absent yourself from the University
without leave, we have decided that <a href="#image14">you must
consider yourself off the Varsity</a> for the period of
one week. We rely on you not to leave the University
pending the investigation. I am sorry.”</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 436px;">
<a name="image14" id="image14">
  <img src="images/image14.jpg" width="436" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_91">“You must consider yourself off the varsity.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>He shook Hal’s hand warmly after this dignified
speech and expressed the hope that the matter could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
be cleared up soon. He assured Hal that no expense
or labor would be saved in that direction.</p>

<p>Then they let him go home and it was the saddest
trip Hal ever took in the direction of Mrs. Malcolm’s
home. Whether they considered him guilty of the
greater crime or not, he was disgraced anyhow.
Surely it was a hard punishment to give an impetuous
young fellow for simply wanting to go home and for
the reason that Hal thought he had.</p>

<p>He went up the stairs to his room with a heavy
heart—a heart that ached in every way. He felt
that he was done for.</p>

<p>Hans’ door was open and he heard Hal come in.</p>

<p>“Been up on the green carpet?” asked Hans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
“That’s what they say, isn’t it when they send for
you like that?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hal, dejected.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter now? Nothing about the
medal or our trip to Boston, was it?” went on Hans.
But before he could answer, Hal broke down and
went all to pieces. “I’m disgraced,” he almost
shouted in his agony.</p>

<p>“Tell me what happened,” said Hans when he
had quieted him down somewhat. Then Hal told
him all that had taken place and what had been said,
the pawnbroker’s story and everything, winding up
by repeating the president’s speech which he could
recite almost word for word, so forcibly had every
syllable sunk into his brain.</p>

<p>“I’m disgraced,” he concluded.</p>

<p>Hans was thunderstruck. Did they connect him
with it in any way? Was his name mentioned?
Why didn’t they? It was preposterous. He had
Hal go over different parts of the story again and
again. They didn’t believe Hal guilty, yet they
put him off the team for a week.</p>

<p>“We must clear this up,” said he, finally, when
he had a little time to think. “We must clear it
up within a week. How I don’t know, but it must
be done. Don’t worry about being suspended for
a week. No one but Hughie need know. You can
fix it up with him that your foot is paining you again
from Crossley’s spikes and carry your cane and limp
a little. Hughie will protect you. He likes you well
enough for that. At the end of the week you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
get well again. We don’t need to worry about that
end of it. We’ve got to go over this thing step by
step and account for everything that happened to
you and me from the time you left this house that
day until you got back. Now let’s get busy,” and
they started in on the hardest proposition they had
ever tackled.</p>

<p>Item by item they went over the day’s happenings
again and again. They started in with Hal’s leaving
Mrs. Malcolm’s house on the way to the station.</p>

<p>“Did you walk or did you take the car? Who
took your trunk! Did you talk to anybody?
Whom?”</p>

<p>These were the kind of questions Hans fired at
Hal like shots out of a gun. For once this phlegmatic
young man was thoroughly aroused and excited.
Whenever he asked a question that Hal
couldn’t answer he would say “Think! Think!”</p>

<p>They went over everything up to the time Hal
took the train, and they found no clew of any kind.
Hal had talked to no one except the ticket agent,
the policeman at the corner, and yes! he did ask
another man whom he met as he ran out of the station
about the location of a pawnshop but the other fellow
was hurrying too and he guessed he hadn’t heard his
question because he didn’t stop. Hal hadn’t either.</p>

<p>Then they went all over the incidents of the ride
to Boston, meeting with Delvin, waiting in the station
for him, Hal’s visit to the pawnshop, the dinner
at Delvin’s and the vaudeville show but found nothing
that would give them a start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Hans had Hal tell the pawnbroker’s story
over again, word for word as near as he could remember
it. When Hal came to the part about the
envelope Hans stopped him.</p>

<p>“Do you remember where you got that envelope
and how you happened to write your name on it?”</p>

<p>“Why yes, I got it off my desk that day when I
was packing. I remember I wrote my name and
home address on it and put it in my handkerchief
pocket intending to leave it at the post office as a
forwarding address for my mail.”</p>

<p>“Did you leave it there?”</p>

<p>Hal thought a moment. “No, I’m sure I forgot
all about that. I didn’t go to the post office at all.”</p>

<p>“Then it must have been in your pocket on the
train. You may have pulled it out of your pocket
with your handkerchief on the train,” continued
Hans.</p>

<p>“I can’t remember having used my handkerchief
on the train,” said Hal, “but I do recollect now
that when I came out of the pawnshop I was perspiring
freely from slight nervousness and the excitement
of knowing the great value of my watch.”</p>

<p>“That might account for its having gotten into
the pawnshop,” said Hans eagerly, “if the thief was
near there and happened to see it (then in a
moment). Sure that’s what happened. Didn’t he
show up within five minutes after you left the place?
You drop the envelope on the sidewalk without knowing
it, he comes along, sees it, picks it up, and as one
name is as good to him as another, and as he doesn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
expect to call for the medal again, he fixes up that
story for the pawnbroker to show him he doesn’t
want to part with the medal forever and that makes
the broker loan him the money on it, because they
had rather make loans to people who redeem their
pledges than not. People who do this have the habit
and become steady customers. We’re doing fine.”</p>

<p>By that time it was nearly daylight. They had
been up all night without noticing it. They felt
they had made a start. At last they decided to get
an hour or two of sleep.</p>

<p>Hal went to his bed exhausted but couldn’t sleep,
he was so worried. Hans fell asleep promptly or
thought he did. As a matter of fact he was only
half dozing with the problem going through his
mind. He was so intent on it that he was thinking of
it unconsciously and as he thought he was asleep he
thought he had a dream of getting on a train to go
some place. Oh yes, he was trying to find Hal, he
was getting on the back end of the train and as he
walked into the car he saw Hal sitting on the last seat
of the car, blue hat, mixed gray suit and all, and he
saw himself going up to speak to him and greet him in
true college-boy style, hitting his friend on the back
as hard as his right hand would permit him, and just
as his hand was about to fall on Hal’s shoulders he
looked and, “By George!” said Hans, jumping out
of bed and running over to Hal’s room like mad,
shouting, “I’ve got him. The fellow with the blue
glasses! Blue hat, gray suit, just like yours on the
same train.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he told Hal about the fellow on the train
whom he had almost forgotten. How he thought he
was Hal and was just about to hand him one when
he had noticed the blue glasses and then found it
wasn’t Hal. He wound up by saying, <a href="#image15">“Find the
other fellow with</a> the blue hat, the mixed gray
suit and <a href="#image15">the blue glasses</a> and we’ve got the medal
thief.”</p>

<small>THE STUDENT DETECTIVES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The first thing they did in the morning was to
hunt up Hughie. They routed him out before breakfast.
When they saw him they told him the whole
story from beginning to end. They told him about
Hal’s suspension for a week, and fixed it up with
him for Hal to carry his cane and limp when anybody
was around. Then Hans got excused from practice
for a few days, also without any particular reason
except the one to Hughie that he wanted to put in
his spare time on a little detective work.</p>

<p>After breakfast they went to Mr. Williams’
house. It was still before hours, and after a little
delay, Mr. Williams came downstairs. Hans told
him about seeing the fellow with the blue glasses
on the train, also that he had a hat and suit on that
looked a good deal like Hal’s. Mr. Williams was
deeply interested and gave them both permission to
absent themselves from class for a few days, asking
them to report to him each evening. He said, too,
he would tell the detective whom they would employ
that day so they could help run down the clew.</p>

<p>For three days they hunted the town over to find
a merchant who might have sold a blue cloth hat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
like Hal’s, but without result. The same thing happened
when they tried to find one who had sold a
pair of blue glasses. They didn’t make a bit of
progress. The station agent couldn’t recall anyone
with a blue hat buying a ticket to Boston that day.
He didn’t even remember that Hal had worn that
kind of a hat or a gray suit, or even that he had
bought a ticket.</p>

<p>The next morning passed also without result. At
noon they went over to Springville, the next town, to
investigate the stores there to see if they could find
a clew.</p>

<p>As they were going into the town, the car stopped
to give an automobile a chance to cross the track
ahead of them. This called Hans’ attention to the
automobile. There was no one in it but the driver,
but he had on a blue cloth hat and wore blue glasses.
Hans jumped up and leaned out to get a better view
of the occupant, shouting to Hal: “<a href="#image16">Get the number
of that machine</a> quick.” Hal did so, but just then
Hans said, in a disappointed tone, “Never mind the
number, the driver’s colored and the man who wore
the blue glasses was white.” So they went back to
their seats more disappointed than ever. When they
had gone a little farther, however, Hans burst out,
“Do you remember that number yet?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 416px;">
<a name="image16" id="image16">
  <img src="images/image16.jpg" width="416" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_99">“Get the number of that machine.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Yes,” said Hal, “27,843, Mo. There was another
smaller number underneath, but I couldn’t get
that one.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go back,” said Hans. “I have a hunch
that we ought to investigate that car.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>With that they swung off the trolley and after
waiting a few minutes along came another car going
in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>“That auto may stop in Lowell. I don’t suppose
it will do any good, but it’s the first thing that looks
like a clew that we have had, and we’d better follow
it up.”</p>

<p>When they got back to town they visited all the
garages in the city without explaining their mission,
and looked at the numbers on all the cars. They
didn’t find the one they were looking for, so they
went down to report to Mr. Williams. He was very
much interested.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you ask the garage people if they
had seen a car with that number?”</p>

<p>“Guess we didn’t know enough,” said Hans.
“We’re not such great detectives after all.”</p>

<p>Mr. Williams thought enough of the clew to say
that he would have one of the detectives interview
the managers of the garages and find out if a car
of that number had been in town that day and to
see if they could trace it. “We can also write to
St. Louis and find out who owns that Missouri
number.”</p>

<p>Hans and Hal then went to their rooms to get
ready for dinner, for their work made them hungry,
although of course Hans had the better appetite of
the two. In the evening they were sitting in Hans’
room when there was a knock on the door. Hal
opened it and there was Mr. Williams.</p>

<p>“We’ve found the automobile,” said Mr. Williams.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
“It belongs to one of the students of the University
who has a colored driver. The driver has
been employed for only a month and I am afraid that
there is nothing in our clew. The machine belongs
to Crossley.”</p>

<p>Hans jumped about four feet in the air: “Crossley
did you say?” The jump seemed to give him power
to think quick. “Could it be possible. Could he
do such a thing? I hardly think so. He wouldn’t
have any reason for it. He has plenty of money.”
He was thinking out loud. “Wait, let me see. He
might not want to do it just for money. He deliberately
spiked Hal. He seemed to have it in for him
for some reason. Come to think of it that fellow on
the train looked something like him under those
glasses.” Then came “yes, it might have been
Crossley.”</p>

<p>The others sat watching him in amazement. Finally
Hans turned to Mr. Williams and told him what
he had noticed about the deliberate spiking of
Hal. He could give no motive and neither could
Hal say why Crossley might dislike him.</p>

<p>When he had finished Mr. Williams said, “I
hardly think it could be possible. Still I think I had
better send for Crossley; I will do so right away.”
He promised to let the boys know later in the evening
if anything worth while resulted. As a matter
of fact Mr. Williams had concluded there might be
more in the idea than he had let on. He sent Crossley
a note like the one he had sent Hal, asking him to
come to the office at once, late though it was. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
he added a few words at the bottom: “Bring your
chauffeur’s hat and goggles.”</p>

<p>When Crossley received the note he read it only
once, but he knew it was all up with him. He had
been having a pretty uncomfortable time himself
during the past days, but it was only when he received
Mr. Williams’ note that the utter baseness
of his misdeeds became fully apparent to him. He
couldn’t stand the thought of facing Mr. Williams
and Hal.</p>

<p>Like a lot of the boys, he was brave only until
he was called upon to stand a real test, and Crossley’s
training wasn’t the kind that would let him take
his medicine. So he didn’t even wait until the messenger
had gone. His automobile was standing at
the curb in front of his quarters. He didn’t stop
for anything, not even to pack up, nor did he wait
for his driver. He dashed down the stairs, jumped
into his automobile and went away as fast as his
machine could carry him. The messenger boy reported
to Mr. Williams what he had seen and he
said, “He must be the guilty party. His flight surely
was a confession.”</p>

<p>He called up Hal and Hans and told them what
had happened and that Hal might consider the suspension
removed.</p>

<p>As for Crossley this is where he goes out of the
story. They struck his name from the rolls of the
University. No doubt he turned up at his home in
due time, but the University authorities never made
any attempt to punish him. They were satisfied that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
he had gone without bringing the fair name of the
school into more disrepute.</p>

<p>They packed up his things and sent them to his
home, and if they were ever called upon by Crossley’s
father to explain anything about the matter will probably
never be known. Nothing was ever said about
it one way or the other at Lowell. The college people
sent out the news that the medal had been found,
leaving anyone to guess whether it had really been
stolen or mislaid.</p>

<p>President Lawrence sent for Hal and thanked
him for the courage he had shown while under the
cloud, again expressed his sorrow that he had been
forced by circumstances to put him under suspicion,
and Hal went home feeling more relieved than he
had ever felt in his life.</p>

<p>As for Hans he was jubilant. Hal felt particularly
grateful to him for his clever work in clearing
up the mystery and wanted to tell the story at the
training table in order that Hans should have full
credit, but Hans objected in his modest way and so
they kept the story absolutely to themselves and were
happy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>HAL IS DISCOVERED</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The season was coming along rapidly. The first
big game of the year with Armour was only a week
off and the Varsity was hardly prepared for it. Baseball
in the big colleges had come to be almost as
scientific as in the professional leagues, which by the
way were full of college men—they having been rapidly
replacing the old-time every-man-for-himself
sluggers who learned their baseball on the back lots,
and who while “Kings of the game” in their days
were no match for the scientific brainy players of
inside baseball which had been developed in the colleges.
Also the fact that college-trained men were
taking positions in the professional leagues, took a
good deal of the rowdyism out of the game and increased
its popularity with the “fans” all over the
country.</p>

<p>Lowell University had been the first to develop
the clever “inside ball” as it had come to be called
and the other colleges had taken it up. A big part
of “inside ball” is made possible by the “signals”
which each of the players had to know and remember.</p>

<p>They had signals for every combination that could
be imagined, some of the players, as, for instance, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
shortstop, the key to the infield, had fifteen signals,
all of which he had to keep in mind, and any one of
which he might have to use at any moment. The
other players had their own signals, too, and every
player on the team must be familiar with every other
player’s signals, while at bat. Otherwise if two men
used the same signals the opposing players would
soon catch on to what was going to be tried.</p>

<p>And so before this first big game with Armour,
Hughie spent most of the practice hours training
the men in the use and understanding of the signals,
so that each man on the bases could tell by watching
just what the batter would try to do, and if the
opposing team was at bat, the Lowell boys in the
field signaled to each other how to play if the ball
went here or there.</p>

<p>Then there was practice in base running, sliding,
etc., particularly the fall-away slide. Ty Robb and
Honus enjoyed the sliding. These two stole more
bases in practice and regular games than all the other
men on the team put together.</p>

<p>The rules of the game give the runner absolute
right to the base paths, otherwise a baseman could
always block a runner. The average player, even
though courageous, starts his slide when about fifteen
feet from the bag, so that by the time the bag is
reached the slider is not coming at very fast speed—he
is almost stopped in fact, and it is easy for the
baseman to tag him without much danger from spikes.
But Ty and Honus were daredevils. Neither knew
what fear was. They got onto the fact that by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
starting to slide when about eight feet from the base
they would sail into it full speed, and that nine times
out of ten the baseman was afraid to try to touch
them even if he had the ball. So Ty and Honus
were detailed to teach the others how to slide, and
everyone was working hard to perfect the team
work.</p>

<p>At the end of the week the team took its first trip
out of town, when they went to Hudson City for the
annual game with Armour, which always had one of
the best teams in the East. The boys arrived after
an all-night ride in the sleeper, but by the time breakfast
was over and they reached the ground for a little
warming-up practice, everyone was feeling fine with
the exception of Huyler, the substitute infielder who
sprained his ankle, and had been sent to a hospital
to have it attended to, and Hal, who had been
brought along, but who saw no chance whatever to
get into the game, since Miner was in fine form and
Babe had developed into a pretty steady winner.
Nothing but an avalanche of singles, two-baggers,
and homers would give him a chance that day.</p>

<p>It looked like rain almost up until the game had
been called.</p>

<p>Hudson City was one of the largest college towns
in the country. Fifteen thousand people could be
seated in the stands, and they were filled, while five
thousand others stood or sat on the ground. A thousand
Lowell boys and two thousand Lowell graduates
were seated in the stands back of third base
where the visiting players’ bench was also located.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Down in the field in front of the section where the
Lowell boys sat were four Lowell boys with megaphones
and without coats or hats who led the yelling
and the singing, and the wearers of the green did
their best to make as much noise and sing as loud as
the more numerous adherents of the orange (Armour’s
color), who sat in the stands back of first base
and spread out on the field, and who would have won
the game purely on their enthusiasm if they could.
Last year Armour had played at Lowell and had lost,
but they had a good time anyhow with their cheering
and their singing, and especially after the game when
the Lowell crowd entertained them.</p>

<p>That afternoon the team came nearer to defeat
than at any time so far that year. The advantage of
being champions had been partly offset by the big
hostile crowd in the stand. The feeling of nervousness
was shared by Hughie and the coaches over
the one weak spot, first base, in what would
otherwise have seemed to him a championship team.
Dill had been tried and found wanting, and Ross
was given the job. He was at times fit, but at other
times he made the rankest errors and occasionally
made such a boneheaded play that it upset the confidence
of the whole team.</p>

<p>“If this is one of Ross’s good days,” said Hughie,
“we’re all right; but if he is as bad as he was two
weeks ago in the game with Colfax, then look out.
We have no one else to put in, and we can’t win
from this crowd if it’s a bad day for Ross.”</p>

<p>Then the gong sounded, the umpire said “Play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
ball,” the Armour boys took their places in the field
and the game was on.</p>

<p>Everson led off for Lowell and drew a base on
balls. Captain sacrificed him to second; Honus drove
a hot one to the shortstop, who fumbled but recovered
in time to catch the runner at first, Everson taking
third. Ty placed a neat single over the second
bag and Everson came in, Ty taking second on the
throw in. Tris came up next and drove a hot one
past third base and Ty came all the way home on
the hit. Tris being held on first, Delvin hit a screamer
down the first-base line, which rolled to the fence, and
Arthur made the round trip with Tris ahead of him.
Ross, the next man up, struck out.</p>

<p>“That’s a bad sign,” said Hughie to himself as
Ross walked down to first and picked up his glove.</p>

<p>Carter, the first man up for Armour, fouled out;
Wilson, the next batter, hit a long fly to Ty; Blair,
the next man up, hit a grass-scorcher over second.
Honus rushed over, made a beautiful pick up with
one hand and a perfect throw to Ross ten feet ahead
of the runner, and Ross muffed the ball. Gibbie signaled
to Miner to throw to first to catch the runner
who had taken a big lead. His throw was good, but
Ross again muffed. The next man up made a clean
hit over third, and Blair, the man on first, got clear
around to third. Hughie signaled the infield to play
in close, because a hit would bring in a run anyhow.
The batter tapped an easy one toward Ross, who
picked it up neatly, but while he was making up his
mind where to throw it, the man on third came in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and the batter reached first. The next man sent a
high fly to left, which Cap. gathered in. Score, 4
to 1.</p>

<p>In Lowell’s half of the second we went out in one-two-three
order. In Armour’s half, Miner was unsteady
and passed Clymer, the first man. Then he
struck out the second batter. The next man up laid
a neat bunt down toward third; Delvin came rushing
in, scooped it up neatly and hurled it straight for the
bag. <a href="#image17">Again Ross muffed the ball</a>, and before he
had recovered it the batter was safe and Clymer who
had received the base on balls originally was perched
on third. By this time the nervousness had spread to
the rest of the team. A hit would mean another run.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 484px;">
<a name="image17" id="image17">
  <img src="images/image17.jpg" width="484" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_109">“Again Ross muffed the ball.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>The next man up, who was the pitcher, dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
an unexpected hit in short right, but Ty who had
crept in pretty close made a quick pick up and threw
to first ahead of the runner who had expected the
throw to go to the plate and had come down slow.
But Ty had seen at once he could not catch the man
going home, so he did the unexpected and caught the
man at first, and as good luck would have it Ross
caught the throw while everybody felt that he would
have muffed it again if it hadn’t been so unexpected.
Brain, the next batter, hit an easy grounder to Ross
who touched first and the side was retired. Score,
Lowell, 4; Armour, 2.</p>

<p>It was easy for Armour to see that the weak spot
in the Lowell team was first base and they directed
all their play toward that point, the batters trying
to drive the ball down that way continually. Then
for three innings and in Lowell’s half of the sixth,
the sides went out in one-two-three order. Miner
knew he must make them either strike out or put
them up in the air, and the flies were all caught by
Lowell’s fielders, so the other boys made no runs.
Practically the same things happened to Lowell. We
got one or two more hits but they were scattered
and nothing happened.</p>

<p>But in the last half of the sixth inning came more
trouble. The first man up batted a pretty swift
grounder toward first base and it passed through
Ross’ legs though Ty came racing in and held the
runner on first. It was a sure thing there would be
more runs if they continued to direct the attack on
Ross. Everson and Miner stalled to give Ross a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
chance to cool off and Jenkins was tearing his hair
on the bench because he had no one to send to take
Ross’ place. Dill, the only other man who had ever
played the bag, was not with the team, and Huyler
was unexpectedly hurt. Once Hughie turned to Hal
and said, “Do you think you could cover that
bag?”</p>

<p>“I have never tried it,” said Hal, “but if you
order me in there, I’ll do my best for you and Lowell.”
By that time, however, play had been resumed.
The whole team was nervous. They felt that any
ball batted to Ross would be missed, and that if they
did stop anything, Ross would miss the throw. Miner
temporarily lost control again, giving another base
on balls, making a man on first and one on second,
with nobody out. This helped to increase the nervousness
of the whole team, and even Hughie began
to lose his nerve apparently. Webb, the batter, hit
the next ball pitched for a line drive over Honus’
head, who did the best he could and knocked it down,
but too late to get his man at first. Three men on
bases and nobody out, and any kind of a hit meant a
run, and possibly two. The next man up again
directed his attention to Ross, and hit another easy
grounder toward him. Ross made a beautiful stop
and setting himself deliberately for the throw, for he
had plenty of time, threw straight for the plate, but
ten feet over Gibbie’s head, and two runs came
in, tying the score. Hughie was wild, the team
was wild, the Lowell “rooters” were wild, the
score was tied, no one out, and Marsh of Armour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
was on second. Hughie walked over to Hal and
said:</p>

<p>“Go in; you can’t do any worse than that.”</p>

<p>Hal said: “I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p>Hal’s entry into the game didn’t help the rest of
the team back to confidence any. The whole team
was up in the air, and now they had an entirely unknown
quantity to deal with at the initial sack. Hal
was most nervous of all of them, of course, although
as soon as Honus saw what was up he walked over to
meet him and said:</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, I told you several times you would
make a good first baseman, and you paid no attention
to me. Now you got to do it.”</p>

<p>Of course, the Armour team knew Hal must be
untried, or Hughie would not have hesitated so long
about putting him in, and they decided if they could,
they would continue their attack upon the custodian
of first base. The situation now was a tied score,
no one out and a man on second.</p>

<p>The first man up sent a hot grounder to Honus.
He got it, held it long enough to hold the man on
second close to the bag, but too long to make the
throw to first easy. Therefore he threw it with all
his might at Hal, and in doing so he threw it very
wide of the bag. Hal saw it coming with the speed
of a bullet; he also saw the runner rushing toward
him along the base line. His throwing or really his
pitching hand was his left hand, and that was bare.
To run up the base line far enough to get that ball
in his gloved hand meant a collision with the runner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to take it with his bare left probably meant a crippled
hand and the loss of his pitching ambition.</p>

<p>All this he seemed to think of as that ball was
rushing at him across a space of possibly one hundred
feet from where Honus stood and in probably one-half
a second of time. By that time the ball was upon
him. Should he take it with his left or should he run
up the base line and get it with his right? He did
neither; <a href="#image18">he stuck his left foot in the bag, whirled
quickly around with his back to the ball, stretched out
his right mitt, stuck it out in the air and caught the
ball with one hand</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 432px;">

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_113">“He stuck his left foot in the bag, whirled quickly around with his back to the ball,
stretched out his right mitt, stuck it out in the air and
caught the ball with one hand.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Runner out!” was all he heard, and the crowd
and his team mates, the Armour boys and even the
man on second were so thunderstruck with the quickness
of it all and the apparent ease with which it was
done that they cheered for five minutes, and the man
on second forgot to run home while he had a chance.
Nothing like it had ever been seen before on any ball
ground. Surely he did not think that out while the
ball was coming toward him. He couldn’t have
thought it out. He didn’t have time. It was instinct—a
sort of baseball eighth sense. Hughie was
dancing up and down before the bench with joy,
plucking blades of grass now with one hand, now
with another, whistling through his fingers, sticking
one leg out before him straight, yelling “Eyah.”</p>

<p>The whole team was wild, but with a different kind
of wildness. A fellow that could do that was a natural
ball player. If he could make one stop like that
he could make another. This game didn’t make so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
much difference now—they had discovered a first
baseman. Hughie knew it, the whole team knew it—and
the opposing team knew it—they all sensed it.
The fans in the stands may not have realized it, and
Hal was sure he didn’t know what it was all about,
in fact, he hardly knew yet what he had done.</p>

<p>The umpire had called time to let the excitement
subside, and after a few minutes play was resumed.
From nervousness the team had gone to the other
extreme. They were exhilarated. The next man up
hit a low liner over third. Delvin rushed over, stuck
out his right hand and the ball stuck; two out. The
next man hit a hot grounder to Everson, who relayed
it to Hal. Out of pure joy, he fired it about five feet
over Hal’s head. Again the latter figured over
quickly in his mind how to get that ball. While he
was thinking about it his instinct made him leap up
in the air and stick up his gloved hand into space, and
again the ball stuck and came down with him as he
landed on the bag, two feet ahead of the runner.
Three out.</p>

<p><a href="#image19">Again the crowd went wild.</a> “What’s his name?
He’s a wonder. Where did he learn to play first
base?” and such expressions were heard on all sides
as he walked to the bench. After that it was easy.
The team simply had the confidence, more of it than
they ever had before. Armour on the other hand
was now nervous. Miner didn’t let them have another
hit and the Lowell boys pounded out five more
runs, so that the final score stood 9 to 4 in favor of
the champions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 413px;">

  <img src="images/image19.jpg" width="413" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_114">“Again the crowd went wild.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>After the game Hal’s team mates crowded around
him. They were wild with joy. In the dressing
room they kept on cheering him.</p>

<p>“Had a first baseman all the time,” said Hughie,
“and didn’t notice it.”</p>

<p>“Told him the first day I saw him he would make
a first baseman,” said Honus, “made a pretty good
guess, didn’t I, Hal?”</p>

<p>“I guess it was an accident,” said Hal, at the
same time knowing that he had found his place.</p>

<p>“Accident nothing,” chimed in Robb and Everson
in chorus.</p>

<p>Just then in walked good old Fred Penny. They
were busy for a few seconds shaking hands with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
old boy. Penny had come over to the game with a
lot of other old Lowell graduates. “I want to see
Case,” said Penny. “I want to ask him where he
learned to play first base.” Then when they introduced
him to Hal, he said: “I’d just like to have
been the office boy for about six months around the
place where they teach that kind of baseball.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Hal, “I suppose after this, I’ll have
to give up the pitching business. I’m willing to
tackle this first-base job on one condition, Penny, and
that is that you come down to Lowell for a week and
teach me a little of what you know about playing that
position.”</p>

<p>“That’s a go,” said Penny. “I feel like getting
into practice myself to get a little of the stiffness out
of my arms and legs.”</p>

<p>That evening they all went to the theater as the
guests of the Armour boys, and after the show took
the sleeper at midnight for home. Hal and Hans
therefore didn’t get a chance to see much of the city,
not as much as they would have liked to.</p>

<p>When they got home next morning before breakfast
the whole student body was down to meet them.
Tim Murnin hadn’t let any grass grow under his feet
in getting the news back to college. His story had
appeared in an extra issue of the <cite>Lowell Reporter</cite>,
the college paper, and they all knew about Hal’s performance.
They had plenty of cheers for the team
in general, but for the moment at least Hal was the
only Great One, and he took his honors as modestly
as he could.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>HANS TAKES A TRIP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>One day in May Hans came into Hal’s room with
a letter from his sister who had come to New York
to be present at the wedding of a former schoolmate
to take place in Brooklyn, the next week. She asked
Hans to come down to New York the following
Thursday and accompany her to the wedding. She
was visiting some friends who lived in one of the
New York suburbs and wrote that she would meet
him at the Grand Central Station at two o’clock in
the afternoon, and he could then take her over to
Brooklyn to be present at the wedding, which was
to be at four o’clock.</p>

<p>Hans had never been in New York before, and
hesitated quite a little about making the trip alone,
and wanted Hal to go along. Hal couldn’t afford
to spend the time or money just then, and reminded
Hans that his sister had been in New York before
and probably knew how to get around the best way,
and he needn’t be nervous. He thought all Hans’
sister wanted him for anyhow, was as escort.</p>

<p>So Hans wrote he would be there on time and made
his preparations for the trip to the big city. While
he was getting ready he got more and more excited.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Like most boys he didn’t care anything about the
wedding, in fact, he’d rather be going for most any
other reason, but he thought he might stay over Sunday
if he got along all right, and see some of the
shows.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’ll have time to see the <cite>Out Door
Weekly</cite> and get a job for both of us canvassing for
subscriptions in our spare time,” he said.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning, bright and early, he took
the train for New York, which left at five o’clock,
but he was not so early but that Hal was up also to
bid him good-by.</p>

<p>“Look out for the confidence men,” said Hal, as
Hans was leaving the house. “If any fellow walks
up to you at the station down there and says, ‘Well!
Well! if it isn’t my old friend Hagner’s son Hans!
How are you, Hans?’ you’d better just walk by and
not notice him.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I know those fellows,” said Hans. “I’ll
see you Monday, and if I don’t have any other
trouble but confidence men, it will be easy.”</p>

<p>But when Hal was going out to chapel the next
morning whom should he meet on the doorstep but
Hans with his grip in his hand, and looking glum
and discouraged.</p>

<p>“What! did they get you so soon as all this?”
asked Hal.</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t talk to me any more about the delights
of New York,” answered Hans, and that was
all Hal could get out of him about his trip for nearly
three days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>By Sunday evening, though, things began to thaw
out with Hans. The boys were both in Hagner’s
room, writing their weekly letters home, telling the
folks all about the troubles of the past few days, and
also some of the good things that had happened during
the week.</p>

<p>Hans had finished his letter with a sigh, as he evidently
wasn’t quite over his New York experience,
and had leaned his head back against the cushions in
the Morris chair and was thinking. All at once he
said, “I have a letter here from my sister which I
got yesterday, but haven’t opened yet, because it probably
has a lot in it about my trip to New York, and
I don’t care to hear any more about that.”</p>

<p>“Better read it,” said Hal. “It isn’t fair to
people who write you letters not to at least read
them.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I’ll have to read it some time,” said
Hans, and he opened the letter and started to read it.
Hal went on with his writing for a while undisturbed,
and then he heard Hans begin to chuckle to himself.
From chuckling he turned to laughing to himself and
finally to laugh out loud. Then he said, “Well, I
guess it depends altogether on how you put it. This
letter from my sister tells something about my trip
to New York. It puts it in an altogether different
light than I had thought of it before, and come to
think of it, it’s really funny, after it is all over.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been dying to ask you what happened,” said
Hal, “but your face during the past three days has
been dark enough to keep anyone from asking questions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
I suppose father’s friends from way back
home got you anyhow.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t see any confidence men,” answered
Hans. “What got me was that I went all the way
to New York to attend a wedding and to see some
of the sights of the town over Sunday and here I am
back at Lowell again within twenty-four hours, without
seeing either the wedding or any of the sights
and just about $25 to the bad.”</p>

<p>“How could that happen?” asked Hal, showing
much interest.</p>

<p>“Well, it was this way,” said Hans. “I got to
the Grand Central Station all right about one o’clock.
The sun was shining and I was feeling pretty good.
There were lots of people coming and going, and the
streets outside were so crowded I thought sure there
was going to be a parade. About half past one it
started to rain and it rained harder than it ever rains
in Texas. Of course I didn’t have any rubbers or
umbrella along, and when my sister got there she
didn’t have any either. It wasn’t raining and didn’t
look like rain when she left the house where she was
visiting.</p>

<p>“She was all dressed up in her finest dress, with
big hat, and looked very pretty, but I couldn’t take
her on a street car in that kind of weather, and so I
said, ‘I guess we’ll have to take a cab.’ She said
under the circumstances she would go in a cab, but
that she would pay for it, because she knew I couldn’t
have very much money, I guess, and she gave me her
pocketbook with some money in it. I told her she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
had better come with me and we would find the best
way to get there. She said we had better take the
Twenty-third Street Ferry to Broadway, Brooklyn,
and thought it would be cheaper to take one cab to
the ferry, then ride across on the boat, and get another
cab on the other side. So <a href="#image20">I asked a cabby to
take us to the Twenty-third Street Ferry</a> and after
we had been riding for about ten minutes we got
there, and when I asked him how much I owed him
he said ‘Three Aces,’ and I said ‘What?’ and he
said ‘Three Dollars.’ So I paid the three dollars
out of sister’s money (she had fifteen dollars), though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
I felt like fighting, and we rode across the East River
on the ferryboat.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 424px;">
<a name="image20" id="image20">
  <img src="images/image20.jpg" width="424" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_121">“I asked a cabby to take us to the 23<sup>rd</sup> St. Ferry.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“When we got over on the Brooklyn side it was
raining harder than ever, and I went out to look for
a cab. There was none in sight, so I telephoned to
six livery stables, but there wasn’t any to be had.
And there we were, stuck in Brooklyn in the ferryhouse
and the rain coming down like anything, and
no cabs.</p>

<p>“I said ‘we better walk,’ but sis said ‘no, she had
an idea’; and she started for the entrance to the
ferryhouse, where I saw a string of carriages approaching.
When I caught up to her I saw it was
a lot of carriages bringing people back from a funeral,
and sister was busy talking to the driver of one
of them. Finally we explained things to the people
inside, and they consented to let us have their carriage,
and they thought they could get a carriage on
the New York side, although it was queer to change
a funeral carriage into one to go to a wedding.
When we got in I told the driver where we wanted
to go, and he sort of smiled, but, of course, I didn’t
know what about. I soon found out though, as after
he had gone about four blocks and turned one corner
the carriage stopped, and the driver got down and
opened the door, saying we were there. I hadn’t
asked him how much it would be, but told him to
wait for us, as it was time for the wedding and we
only expected to be there for a little while.</p>

<p>“The building was one of those apartment houses,
my sister told me—a brand new building with elevators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and boys with brass buttons, and all that.
This was my first sight of an apartment house—this
was the kind which had little apartments—four
rooms and bath, and the young couple who were
getting married had furnished it up very nicely, and
were going to start housekeeping right after the wedding.
Because they had only a little room, they had
rented or obtained the use of the apartment next
door, for people to leave their wraps. The boy
showed us in there.</p>

<p>“A maid showed sister into one room and me into
another, and said, ‘There is a brush and comb and
clothesbrush in the bath-room if you need one.’ I
needed it because I was pretty wet, and my hair was
rumpled. I went into the bath-room, and, of course,
turned the bolt in the door. I brushed my clothes
and combed my hair, and then started to get out.
When I tried to turn the bolt it wouldn’t budge.
You see this apartment had never been occupied and
this bolt in the door had never been tried, so when I
had turned it to lock it, it had worked all right, but
when I tried to unlock it, it had stuck tight in the
door and I couldn’t budge it. <a href="#image21">I tried and tried until
my fingers were worn sore</a> and still I was in there.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 421px;">
<a name="image21" id="image21">
  <img src="images/image21.jpg" width="421" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_123">“I tried and tried until my fingers were worn out.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“The weather was warm and I was perspiring like
a horse after a race. I pounded on the door but nobody
could hear me, because everybody but sister and
the maid had gone in to the wedding. Sister and
the maid were waiting in the other end of the apartment
for me and didn’t hear me. After about fifteen
minutes I began to kick the door and holler. By that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
time sister had begun looking for me, and came to
the door. She asked me why I didn’t come out, and
I said I was locked in, and I told her to find somebody.
I saw at once that I might be in there an
hour or two, so I said she had better go down and
pay off the cabby.</p>

<p>“She said I had all the money, so I slipped a ten-dollar
bill (hers) under the door and she went downstairs
to pay him off. He took the ten dollars and
drove off, and that’s the last we saw of him or any
part of the ten dollars, as he took advantage of the
rain and my sister to drive away. Sister came up excited
and told me about that and I commenced to get
madder than ever. Also I kept getting warmer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Finally sister came and said that she had sent for the
janitor to come up with a monkey-wrench.</p>

<p>“While we were waiting for the janitor the wedding
had taken place and the news got around that
one of the guests was locked in the bath-room. That
broke up the reception more or less and the whole
crowd came over to the other apartment, and stood
in front of the bath-room door, to advise me how to
get out. After half an hour, the janitor came, but
there was no way for him to get the monkey-wrench
to me. Finally, he said he would go round to the
other apartment across the airshaft and <a href="#image22">if I would
hang out of the window on one side, he would do
the same on the other</a> and I could reach the monkey-wrench.
We did this, and both of us got soaked
good and hard by the rain, but I managed to get
hold of the wrench by hanging onto the window-sill
by my toes. I was pretty mad by that time, but
I knew I’d get out quick now, so I walked up to the
door, put the wrench on the knob which was flat
on both sides, and gave her a mighty twist, and
crack! the knob broke off, and I was worse off than
ever.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 429px;">
<a name="image22" id="image22">
  <img src="images/image22.jpg" width="429" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_125">“If I would hang out of the window on one side, he would do the same on the other.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Then the people outside suggested taking the
hinges off the door, which was a good idea, but it
would take more than a wrench to get the pins out,
so the janitor started for a screw-driver. After another
half hour he appeared at the window across
the airshaft again, and I got the screw-driver and
another ducking from the rain, and started to work
on the pins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“They had been put in to stay, but I managed to
get them out in three quarters of an hour, and told
the folks outside to push. They pushed, but the door
wouldn’t budge. You see the bolt in the other side
of the door was just long enough to hold the door
tight and it couldn’t be opened even then.</p>

<p>“By that time it was seven o’clock and the janitor
got an axe and broke out the lower panels with that,
and I finally crawled out. Just as I did so three
policemen came into the apartment and outside I
could hear the fire gongs. Somebody looked out of
the window and there was a hook and ladder company,
which had come in answer to the telephone call
of one of the guests, and were going to get me out
by way of the bath-room window. The wedding,
however, was over, the bride was in hysterics, and
there was nothing left to do, since it was still raining
hard, but to get another cab back to New York in
the hope of getting to the station in time to enable
sister to catch the 8.03 train for Westchester, the
town she was visiting in, and where they were giving
a card party in her honor that night. I was to
go, too.</p>

<p>“We arrived at the station at exactly 8.04 <span class="lcsmcaps">P. M.</span>
The cab fare was five dollars. The next train she
could get would be 9.30, and we hadn’t had a bite
to eat since noon. There was nothing to do but have
some dinner, which I was in no mood for. We went
to one of the hotels near by and ate a little something.
When the waiter brought the bill, it was nine dollars
and eighty cents, and I never paid over fifty cents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
for a good dinner in my life. I had paid out eighteen
dollars in cash for three different cab rides—one of
ten minutes, three dollars; one of five minutes, ten
dollars; and one of an hour, five dollars. Fifteen
dollars of this was sister’s money. The dinner cost
me nine dollars and eighty cents, which made twelve
dollars and eighty cents of my own money I had spent
on a wedding which I didn’t see, and on a trip to
New York on which I saw nothing but a lot of thieving
cabbies.</p>

<p>“By that time I was so angry I was red in
the face, and the madder I got the more sister
laughed, until I got out of patience with her
and put her on the train, while I took the sleeper
for Lowell, and I have been mad at things in general
ever since, until now I begin to think it was
laughable myself, after it is all over, though it
cost a lot of money, and I didn’t see much of the big
city.”</p>

<p>While Hans was telling this Hal sat in his chair
and roared and laughed until he couldn’t laugh any
more. It must have been awfully funny with Hans
telling it in his own peculiar way. Hal said finally
he thought Hans had had a pretty good time riding
around in cabs all day just like a real New Yorker,
but Hans said he had enough of riding in cabs, and
he didn’t like weddings anyhow.</p>

<p>After a little while, Hal finished his letter and
went into his own room. Then he sat down to write
the story of Hans’ experience in New York to his
folks. He started in with a new sheet of paper and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
just for fun he wrote it out like a story, heading and
all. The heading was like this:</p>

<p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Going to a Wedding in Brooklyn from
New York, U. S. A.</span></p>

<p class="noic"><span class="smcap">By Harold Case</span></p>

<p>Then he wrote out the story very much as Hans
had told it to him, adding a touch here and there as
the funny side of it occurred to him again, and when
he had finished it he started to put it in the letter
which he had written to his folks at home. What
he really did, however, was to make a mistake
through pure carelessness which, had he only known
it, was to cause him not only a lot of joy but a great
deal of happiness.</p>

<p>He had addressed a letter to the editor of the <cite>Out
Door Weekly</cite> in New York for terms to agents soliciting
subscriptions to the magazine, as Hans and
he had talked about before Hans’ trip to New York.
The scheme was for Hans and himself to try to get
orders for the magazine by the year from the people
who lived in near-by towns, and the letter had to be
written, now that Hans had come back from New
York without seeing the people. Now when he came
to put the story about Hans, intended only for his
folks, in the letter he had written them, he picked
up the wrong envelope and stuck the story in the envelope
addressed to the editor of the <cite>Out Door
Weekly</cite>, and the letter he intended for the editor he
put in the envelope addressed to his folks along with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
his regular letter. Then he mailed them and went
to bed.</p>

<p>About a week later, among the letters received by
Hal was one from the <cite>Out Door Weekly</cite>, and Hal
opened it to see what they had to say about the job
of getting subscriptions which they had asked for.
When he opened the letter something dropped out
of it to the floor, and upon picking it up found it
was a check for $250, made out to Harold Case.
Of course, he didn’t understand this so he opened
the letter, and this is what he read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi">“<span class="smcap">Mr. Harold Case</span>,</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: We beg to advise you that your story
has been accepted by the editor and will appear in
the next issue. We have taken the liberty of putting
our own title on it.</p>

<p>“Inclosed please find check for $250 in payment
of same. Any time you have any stories as good as
this to submit for publication, we trust you will favor
this magazine.</p>

<p class="right r6">“Yours very truly,</p>

<p class="right r1">“<span class="smcap">Walton Kemp</span>, <i>Editor</i></p>
<p class="right">“<cite>Out Door Weekly</cite>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Hal couldn’t understand it and so he took the
letter, check and all, into Hans’ room, and asked him
what he made out of it.</p>

<p>“Guess somebody made a $250 mistake,” said
Hans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“They certainly have got me mixed up with some
author,” answered Hal. “I didn’t send them any
story. The only thing I have sent to this magazine
is the letter which you asked me to write about the
job as agents for their magazine.”</p>

<p>“Well, have you written any stories to anybody?”
asked Hans.</p>

<p>“Not that I know of,” answered Hal. “The
only story I have written lately was this. When
you told me the tale of your New York visit the other
night I sat down in my room afterwards and wrote
it all out, and sent it to the folks, thinking they would
enjoy it. They feel as though they know you as well
as I do by this time.”</p>

<p>“I have it,” said Hans. “I’ll bet I know what
you have done. You went and put the letter for the
magazine in the letter to your folks and you put the
story about me in the envelope addressed to the magazine,
and they’re going to publish that story about me
all over the country.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose I could make a mistake like
that,” said Hal.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t suppose you could either. But
say, wouldn’t it be a lucky mistake if you had done
it. Think of making a mistake like that and getting
$250 for it. Think of being an author and not
knowing it. That would be rich. If you did make
that mistake I think I ought to lick the stuffing out
of you for advertising me all over the country.”</p>

<p>“All right; but say, maybe I did make that mistake.
Guess I am not entitled to this check unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
I did do something for it, but what on earth anybody
would want to pay $250 for that kind of a story for,
I don’t quite see. Now if I did make that mistake
and they think enough of the story to pay $250, it
would look foolish, wouldn’t it, for me to write them
now and tell them they made a mistake. Wouldn’t
the best way be to wait until Saturday when the next
number of the <cite>Weekly</cite> appears, and we can then see
what story they refer to. And say, if that should be
so, and I made the mistake the way you guess, I’ll
give you half of the profits provided you agree not
to lick me. Anyway, there’s no other name mentioned
but just Hans.”</p>

<p>So they decided to hold the check and wait for the
next number of the magazine which was five days
off. They were very much excited about it. They
could hardly wait until Saturday came. On Friday
Hal got a letter from his folks in answer to the one
he had mailed ten days before, and in it his father
returned him the letter addressed to the magazine
in which they had asked for a job as agents.</p>

<p>Hal then knew he had made a mistake in inclosing
the letters and had sent the story about Hans to the
magazine. It began to look like the $250 check
was really his, by the greatest possible luck. The
next morning they could hardly wait for the news
store to open. They were both on hand before the
doors were unlocked. When the place was opened
they found the magazine wouldn’t arrive until ten
o’clock. That was four hours to wait. They went
home to breakfast but were on hand promptly when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the package arrived from the depot, and eagerly
bought a copy. Hal turned the pages one after the
other until he came to a story headed:</p>

<p class="noic">“<span class="smcap">To a Brooklyn Wedding and Back Again</span>”</p>

<p class="noic"><span class="smcap">A Story from Real Life about Hans</span></p>

<p class="noic"><span class="smcap">By Harold Case</span>
</p>

<p>“There she is,” said Hal. “Now what do you
think of that?” They read it through together.
Eight whole pages. It was almost exactly as Hal
had written it. The editor had changed a word here
and there and it was illustrated with imaginative pictures
of Hans at the Grand Central, Hans dealing
with the driver of the funeral coach, Hans hanging
out of the bath-room window, and every kind of way.</p>

<p>“By George,” said Hans. “You are an author
and it would be rude to lick an author, but you won’t
have to canvass for the magazine subscribers for a
month or two anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Well, you won’t either,” said Hal. “We’ll
divide it up and when the money’s spent, I’ll send
you on another trip to New York, and if you can
get something else to happen to you, I may be able
to get another story.”</p>

<p>Then they went down to the bank and had the
check cashed and Hal counted out one hundred and
twenty-five dollars which he gave to Hans who immediately
put his in the bank again, to his own credit,
while Hal rolled his up, put a rubber band around
it and stuffed it in his trousers’ pocket.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>PREPARATIONS AT THE RIVAL COLLEGE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The progress of the nine was quite satisfactory
to Hughie and the coaches and they began to feel
as though they had the championship again in their
inside pockets, and they were right in thinking so,
because never before in all the ball teams put together,
in college or out, had there been so many
individual stars on any one team.</p>

<p>“This,” said Hughie, talking with Penny who
had been down for a week, “has been the greatest
luck that any baseball manager ever had, to find himself
at the beginning of the training season with five
of the most important positions of the team vacant
and then to discover among the freshmen, a bunch
of fellows like Case, Hagner, Robb, Talkington and
Radams who make good right away. Of course,
I’d not tell them so to their faces, but those fellows
are playing their positions better than any fellows
who ever played those corners before. They ought
to be world’s champions. Those boys, especially
when steadied by the more experienced bunch we
have left, Everson, Larke, Gibbs, Black and Delvin,
ought to beat any team in the world.”</p>

<p>“They haven’t been beaten yet,” said Everson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
who just came up, “and I don’t think we are going
to be licked this year. Did you ever see such a bunch
of stars?”</p>

<p>“If Jefferson College has anything like our kind
of luck in discovering stars among the freshmen,
there will be the hottest series of ball games that ever
was played anywhere between two teams,” said
Penny.</p>

<p>“It’s hardly possible that Jefferson should have
anything like the same kind of luck,” remarked
Hughie.</p>

<p>Meantime, however, some very similar talk was
going on at Jefferson.</p>

<p>“They licked us at football this year all right
and I still think it was mostly luck that they did,”
said Captain and Manager Frank Church to his
coaches and captains about this same time, “but
we’ve got them this year on the ball game. Won’t
Lowell be surprised though when we turn ’em inside
out on the diamond.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever know of anybody else having the
kind of baseball luck we have had this year?”
asked Tommy Beach, center fielder on the Jefferson
team and good friend of Church’s.</p>

<p>“No,” said Church, “I’ve seen the bad luck
come in bunches often before, such as having a half
dozen of the team put out of the game on account
of injuries in a day, but no one ever had the good
luck we have had in picking out fine kids from a
bunch of freshmen recruits, and have them develop
into stars after the few games we have played.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“This Lowell crowd has put it over us in the
past,” said Big George Mellen, star pitcher of the
Western college, “but methinks that when we have
finished our games with them this year, with the team
we have now, this bunch of fellows will have wiped
out not only all the disgrace of the football defeat,
but also the long string of baseball beatings they
have handed us in the past years.”</p>

<p>About this time, too, various graduates of Lowell
who lived in the West and had had a chance to see
some of the games which Jefferson had played with
other Western colleges, began to think that Church
had finally succeeded in putting a team together that
would, if they kept up the pace which they had set
for themselves, give Lowell a pretty hard tussle.</p>

<p>They could not quite speak what was really their
true opinion because of their great belief in Jenkins,
but when they looked way down deep in their hearts
they not only felt these Western boys might give
Lowell a pretty good tussle, but they were very much
afraid they would take the championship. So they
began sending what seemed at first to their friends at
Lowell to whom they wrote some wonderful stories
of the star players on the new team at Jefferson College,
and gave many warnings that at last Church had
a real ball team, and that when he brought his boys
to Lowell the championship would at least be in
danger.</p>

<p>George Davids wrote to Delvin about a fast
shortstop, who, strange to say, had come from the
East to attend this Western college. “His name is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Eddie Hollins,” wrote George, “and he is a star
performer. He came direct here from Columbus
College and I am surprised that you didn’t hear of
him in time to induce him to go to Lowell. Of
course, you wouldn’t be looking for a shortstop if
you still had Brinker, and I hope you have had some
luck in getting a new one. Hollins, however, is very
fast on the bases and a wonderful fielder. Besides
he is a crack-a-jack with the bat. You know I once
had an idea about playing short myself, but this boy
acts as though he had years of training under Joe
himself.”</p>

<p>From Amos Russell came a long report to Black
about a wonderful pitcher that had been discovered.
“His name is Cam,” wrote Russell, “and his curves
are longer and wider than his name. He was born
in Kentucky which explains why he happened to come
to Jefferson. He is a right hander, with great speed,
sharp curves, and he is long on control. I really
think you had better send some one out here to look
the whole team over. You may be able to discover
some weak points. I have looked them over several
times, and I think that for once dear old Lowell will
have to hustle if they beat this team.”</p>

<p>Dear old Pop Anderson took particular pains to
write about the Jefferson team in general. “I don’t
want to scare you, my dear Hughie,” wrote Pop,
“but you had better be prepared to outdo even yourself
when you come out here to play this year’s Jefferson
team. We didn’t have such a very easy time
with them last year, though the effort it cost made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the victory just that much sweeter. You asked me
to write you fully of what I think and I will do so.</p>

<p>“At first base they have, of course, <a href="#image23">Frank Church</a>
who is, as you know, <a href="#image23">still the captain-manager</a>. I
need not say much about him because you know he
is one of the greatest first basemen ever known, and
it was his ability as a manager you had to beat last
year. I hope you have found some one nearly as
good as Penny to play first. You will need him.”
Hughie chuckled to himself as he thought of his own
wonder at first base.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 438px;">
<a name="image23" id="image23">
  <img src="images/image23.jpg" width="438" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_137">“Frank Church was still Captain Manager.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“At second,” wrote Pop further, “they have as
you know La Joy who is one of the best batters
around in the West. He also is as fine a fielder as
ever, but, of course, you have Johnny Everson and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
you need not worry about that position. At third,
Laird was on last year’s team, the best third sacker
they ever had out here and better this year than ever.
At short they have a youngster named Hollins. He
is a wonder and a great batter. He is brilliant, heady
and fast, and is a dangerous player both at bat and
on the bases. He can play second even better.</p>

<p>“They seem to have had a good deal of luck in
picking up freshmen youngsters who can fill the holes
in the team made by the graduations of last year. I
think this Hollins is a great shortstop, and I hope
you have found a good one in Joe’s place, as you will
surely need him.” Again Hughie smiled to himself.
He was no doubt thinking of Hagner, his big awkward-looking
shortstop. Whenever Hughie wanted
to feel real good he drew a mind picture of Hagner
going after a hot grounder or a Texas Leaguer out
his way.</p>

<p>“They have a great right fielder out here named
Twitchell, also a new man in the position. He is a
fine batter and a good thrower. In center is Thomas
Beach, just as good in the field chasing flies as he was
a couple of years ago at third base. You will, I
know, never forget the trouble this young Beach person
has caused Lowell teams. In the past, reports
of the first inning in so many games read ‘Beach got
a double or triple to left.’</p>

<p>“One thing I have noticed, though, Beach is still
weak when it comes to getting caught at third. Do
you remember how last year King caught him off
third three times when with Church on first and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Tommy on third, they attempted a double steal?
I’ve seen him get caught twice this year the same way.
Funny, isn’t it, that he can’t get over that play. He
just can’t resist the temptation if the catcher makes
a motion as if to throw to second to stop a steal, to
make a false start toward the plate, and when the
catcher throws to third instead of second, <a href="#image24">Beach gets
caught almost every time</a>. Hope you can work it
on him this year again.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 498px;">
<a name="image24" id="image24">
  <img src="images/image24.jpg" width="498" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_139">“Beach gets caught this way every time.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Warcford in left is only a fair fielder, but a wonder
with the bat. He comes from Kansas and is
likely to make trouble at any time with his stick. He
hits all kinds of pitching.</p>

<p>“You will have finally to deal with George Mellen
in the pitcher’s box. He is better than ever.
He has won twelve straight games this year and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
almost as good a batter as any man on the team.
There is also a young pitcher named Cam who promises
to be a wonder. For catcher they have a youngster,
a freshman named Roger Brest. This fellow is
a wonder also. Of course, with Gibbie on the
team—and I think he ought to be fine this year—you
may have the advantage of a catcher with experience
on big college teams, but Brest seems to be a find,
and I think is as good as any. On the whole, they
seem to have had remarkable luck out here with the
team this year.</p>

<p>“It will take all your ability as manager and as
good a team as you had last year to beat them, and
if they keep up the pace they have set with the smaller
colleges out here, you may have the fight of your life
on your hands. They haven’t been scored on as yet.
I hope you have something good up your sleeve. If
you have had any luck with your recruits, we ought
to have the best series of games of college ball ever
played between two nines in the history of the sport,
and with an even break of the luck, it will be the best
team to win.”</p>

<p>Of course all of the reports from all sources were
laid before a committee consisting of Hughie, Everson,
Larke, Gibbie, and one or two others. It made
even Hughie a little anxious. In the enthusiasm
over his team he hadn’t given much thought to
Lowell’s great rivals, because he couldn’t see how
another school could have such luck as he had in
finding stars. Every fellow on the nine was a wonder,
in his opinion. It looked like an all-star team.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>They went over the reports together and compared
the two teams, man for man, as best they could.
The result was enough to make them anxious and
they finally decided to send Young, the coach, who
could tell a real ball player across a fifty-acre lot, out
to Jefferson to look over the rival team and get as
many pointers as he could.</p>

<p>No doubt some fellow from Jefferson had already
been looking the Lowell team over in action or would
be around soon, but of course there was no way to
prevent this, and besides there was no reason why it
shouldn’t be done. The rivalry between the two
schools was of the keenest, in every way.</p>

<p>On the whole the boys decided that if the team
kept on as they had been—working together like a
machine—and if they could avoid a slump, they
would have just as good a chance to win as the other
fellows, and perhaps a little better. They were the
champions and had been for years; and this would
give them a slight advantage.</p>

<p>So they worked a little harder in practice, trying to
perfect themselves more and more in their signal and
other inside work, and every man on the team
pledged himself again and again to Hughie to try a
little more earnestly than he had before, if that were
possible, for the honor and glory of the university.
And this helped them to keep from getting nervous
when they thought of these reports of Church’s team
at Jefferson.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>THE “LOWELL REPORTER”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The <cite>Lowell Reporter</cite> was the college paper of
the University. It appeared once a week and in it
was printed all the news of the college world, and
announcements of various kinds. The advertising
columns furnished an opportunity for a couple of
young hustlers to earn enough money soliciting advertisements
to keep them in school.</p>

<p>The paper was edited entirely by the students under
the watchful eye of the faculty and especially
of Professor Bennett, assistant teacher of English
and of many years’ experience as a newspaper writer
and editor. He also had under his direct supervision
a small class in journalism, a department which had
but recently been founded. The University let the
students’ committee publish the paper themselves,
i. e., to get it ready and then just before being
printed, Professor Bennett would go over the copy
in order to be sure that nothing contrary to the policy
of the University was published and once in a while
to curb the enthusiasm of this or that writer, when he
allowed his imagination to prepare any article that
was not in keeping with the dignity of the institution.</p>

<p>Timothy Murnin, a young Irish lad of American
parentage, was one of the two fellows who kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
themselves in college by hustling for advertisements
for the <cite>Reporter</cite>. Timothy’s one ambition was to
be the owner and editor of a big city newspaper, and
his job of hustling for advertisements was the best
start he could have made in that direction if he only
knew it.</p>

<p>Besides attending to his studies and getting most
of the advertisements for the <cite>Reporter</cite>, Tim added
to his many duties, by request of the student body,
the job of reporting all the sporting events of the
college. His many duties didn’t give him a chance
to indulge in any of the games himself, but he had a
wonderful knowledge of all the sports, football,
baseball, basketball, track work and everything. In
baseball he was particularly fit. Like all good
healthy boys in this country he loved the great
American game of Baseball. He loved it for the
same reason that millions of others loved it—its
squareness and thrills.</p>

<p>He knew the game from “soup to nuts,” as he
would say in talking about the ability of this or that
great player. He could give you offhand the records
of all the great college teams in the country for
twenty years back and the individual fitness of almost
every player. He had them all on his finger
tips, and his reports of the games at college were
filled with items showing that this first baseman acted
like old Pop Anderson, yonder pitcher reminded him
of Russell, or some young catcher threw down to second
like Charley Burnett, or that so and so stood up
to the bat like old Dan Brewers or King Kelly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Once in a while he surpassed himself, and his report
of a dull and uninteresting game was many
times more exciting and enjoyable than the game itself.
Such a game was the one the team played with
Barber College along about the middle of April.
The team had been going along pretty well in the
half dozen or more games which had been played
with the minor colleges, all of them preparatory to
the bigger games toward the close of the season.
Lowell had had a rather easy time of it up to the
fourth inning, at which time the score stood 7 to 0 in
favor of the Varsity. The game had been played in
a drizzle of rain, the ball was wet, the grounds slippery,
and errors were the rule instead of the exception.
Fielders had tumbled over themselves chasing
balls over the wet grass, and players who had attempted
the fall-away slide could hardly be recognized
on account of their mud-stained uniforms.</p>

<p>In the seventh, eighth, and ninth innings, Miner
had given way to Babe, as the game looked safe and
Babe had an off day, for Barber secured six hits in
the three innings, which, mixed with the errors, enabled
the visitors to pile up five runs while the Lowell
team was doing nothing in the tally line.</p>

<p>The game ended, however, with Lowell still two
runs to the good and the game was ours, but this is
the way Tim’s report of parts of it looked in the
<cite>Reporter</cite> the next day after he had reduced his idea
of the contest to writing. Here it is:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Lowell, 7; Barber, 5.</span></p>

<p>Jones, one of the big family, the first to swing the
willow for the enemy, pushed a grass cutter to Hagner,
who relayed it to the custodian of the first salt
bag. Knight hit a sunscraper into the meridian and
Gibbie pocketed it on the return trip. Wilson stung
the pellet to Robbville, which Ty annexed without
leaving his office.</p>

<p>Ross launched a Lusitania to Amberg, which
broke down in midocean. <a href="#image25">Everson loafed around
the rubber</a> for four misfits and got them. Little
Arthur stung a beauty over the near station, which
took him to the first stop and opened the switches
for Everson’s run to the middle junction, Hagner
bumped a daisy scorcher to Joe, which the latter
pickled, but it went as a sacrifice, as Delvin navigated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
to second and the Human Crab breezed to
third. Ty swung his trusty locust against the first
groove cutter and the horsehide stamped his initials
on the Clubhouse flag pole, while he almost beat
Everson and Little Arthur to the water cooler after
his circle of the bags. Mr. Talkington, while waiting
on four, was chased with three, and Larke sent
one singing to the curve box, which the slab artist
tossed to the initial sack ahead of him.</p>

<p>Amberg sent one over the shortest route to Everson.
Wheeler spun three times and sat down.
Dorner imitated Wheeler perfectly.</p>

<p>Black did what was expected of the pitcher. Gibbie
got a one timer back of Wilson. Ross arched
one to Knight. Everson dropped one in front of
the rubber, Gibbie annexing the keystone bag.
Little Arthur was there with a dew drop which Wilson
picked off the grass too late to shut the door on
either Gibbie, Everson or Delvin who slid into the
vacant chairs and all the seats at table were occupied.</p>

<p>The big German lad leaned gently against the
leather apple and knocked it out of the orchard, shaking
the tree for four more juicy ones for Lowell.
Ty fouled to Bowman. Three out. Score, 7-0.</p>

<p>After that for the third, fourth, fifth and sixth
spasms neither side got a look in, although three
hopefuls from each college went boldly to the front,
only to be cut down in their youth, before crossing
the Rubicon.</p>

<p class="noic">SEVENTH INNING</p>

<p>In the stand-up session, however, the tonsorial
artists made the Lowell hair stand up. Hughie sent
the Infant in for a piece of the pie. Jones, the first
shaver up, swung the sign on a drop and raised it
over Arthur’s study box for a single.</p>

<p>The fellow with the after 6 <span class="lcsmcaps">P. M.</span> name waited
patiently, and as the Babe couldn’t see the plate because
Knight was so near, he walked. Wilson hit
a slow one to Johnny which he came in on and
rolled around the sod while Jones, Knight and Wilson
perched on the salt bags. <a href="#image26">Hughie wigwagged
the infield to come close</a>, so they could hear the song<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of the Whirling Sphere and join in the chorus. Amberg
binged one which knocked the wind out of
Hagner’s organ, and Johnny picked up the sphere
and heaved it at the Barber band which was sitting
back of Gibbie behind the screen, to make them join
the music.</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_147">“Hughie wigwagged the infielders to come in closer.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>Jonesy and the Utter Darkness beat a fast tattoo
on the base lines and disappeared over the horizon
to the visitors’ bench after their final journey toward
the West. Loud pedal by the band and the Barber
chorus and two tallies.</p>

<p>Babe got himself in tune by this time and whanged
out three high but perfect notes which Wheeler tried
to reach in unison with him, but couldn’t. Wilson,
who had reached third while the loud pedal was
open, was lulled to sleep by the sweet strains and
caught napping by Gibbie. Dorner sent a whistler
out to Talkington who muffled it and the singing
practice was over. Score, 7-2.</p></div>

<p>The report of the game went on in this style to
the end. Tim had discovered a new language and
he was proud of his effort. When he had finished
he turned in his copy. A few minutes after he
reached home he was called to the telephone. It
was Professor Bennett speaking, and he asked Tim
if he could come around and see him right away.
He had something to talk with him about. When
he reached the professor’s office he found him sitting
with a puzzled expression looking at some manuscript
which Tim thought was his. It was:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t quite understand this, a— I suppose
it is a report of the baseball game with Barber yesterday.”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” said Tim; “don’t you think it’s
pretty good?”</p>

<p>“Have they changed the baseball terms recently?
I hadn’t heard of it. If not, and this is only an
original way of yours of reporting what took place
at the game, I’m afraid that we will have to dispense
with it. I’m afraid that coming out as it does
with the O. K. of the department of English, the
<cite>Lowell Reporter</cite> will be discredited among the
alumni.”</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t cut it out,” said Tim. “Yesterday’s
game was mostly a one-sided and dull affair,
and I thought I’d liven it up a bit by putting some
spirit into the report.”</p>

<p>“Well, but the words and terms you use are not
understandable.”</p>

<p>“I think you are mistaken, Professor, about that.
I think even the smallest boy who knows anything
at all about baseball could understand perfectly what
is meant.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we go over it together,” said the Professor,
“and let me see if I can get an idea what it
is all about. Now, right at the beginning you say
Jones, one of the big family (I can understand that),
the first to swing the willow for the enemy, etc.,
what do you mean by that?” asked the Professor.</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Tim, “the bat is made of willow,
the Barber nine is our enemy for the time being.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
A grass cutter is a ball that is rolled swiftly over
the grass. Jones hit a ground ball to shortstop, who
picked it up and threw it to first base.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said the Professor. “Now let’s see the
rest of it. Knight hit a sunscraper into the meridian
and Gibbie pocketed it on the return trip.”</p>

<p>“Perfectly plain, Professor,” said Tim. “A
high building is a skyscraper—then a high ball might
be a sunscraper—the meridian is directly overhead,
isn’t it? Then this ball that Knight hit went straight
up in the air, very high, Gibbie the catcher caught
it easily when it came down.”</p>

<p>“Not bad,” said the Professor. “Let’s take the
next line. Wilson stung the pellet to Robbville,
which Ty annexed without leaving his office.
What——?”</p>

<p>“That means,” continued Tim, “that Wilson hit
the ball hard to right field where Tyrus Robb plays,
and hit it absolutely into his hands. He didn’t have
to leave his office means, he didn’t have to move to
get it.”</p>

<p>“I begin to be interested in your new style of
English. It seems all right if you have a key handy.
Are you going to furnish a glossary of terms with
each of your reports after this, Murnin?</p>

<p>“Suppose we go on. Now then you say: Ross
launched a Lusitania to Amberg which broke down
in midocean. What possible connection can there
be between a fast liner and a ball game?”</p>

<p>“You have it. Fine. Don’t you see how quickly
the meaning comes to you when you get a start?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Lusitania—a fast liner—launched to Amberg—went
straight for him—broke down in midocean—it
stopped when it got to Amberg, who caught it.”</p>

<p>“Good, now let’s see if I can figure it out myself.
Everson loafed (waited) around the rubber (the
plate) for four misfits (four balls, I guess); Little
Arthur (must be Delvin) stung a beauty (a good
one) over the near station—near station? (Oh! yes,
third base) which took him to the first stop (first
base) and opened the switches for Everson’s (let’s
see, where was Everson? Oh, yes, he got a base
on balls and was on first) run to the middle station
(Everson got to second), Honus bumped a daisy
scorcher (now, what’s a daisy scorcher, Tim?)”</p>

<p>“A low ball, not one rolling on the ground, but
a little raised, about as high as the daisy blossoms.”</p>

<p>“Good, Honus bumped a daisy scorcher to Jones
which the latter pickled (he must have gotten it and
put Honus out if it went as a sacrifice). Delvin
navigated to second (advanced to second) and the
Human Crab breezed to third. (Who’s the Crab?
Let me see, he must have been on second. Do you
call Everson the Human Crab?)”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tim.</p>

<p>“This is the situation now, isn’t it? Everson on
third, Delvin on second. All right, now let’s see
what happened.”</p>

<p>“Ty swung his trusty locust (thought it was willow)
against the first groove cutter (let me see, that
must mean a ball put over the plate) and the horsehide
(ball) stamped his initials on the Clubhouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
flag pole (the ball must have hit the flag pole, eh?)
and Ty almost beat Everson and Little Arthur to
the water cooler (that’s almost too plain, Tim. Ty
made a home run and brought home Everson and
Delvin. Better improve that one a little).”</p>

<p>“I think it will average up,” said Tim.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Professor Bennett. “What happened
next? Mr. Talkington (why mister, I wonder?)
while waiting for four (trying to get his base
on balls) was chased with three (what, get his base
on three balls?).”</p>

<p>“No, sir, he struck out. They chased him to
the bench.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see!” said the Professor. “Larke sent
one singing to the curve box (that must be the
pitcher) which the slab artist (pitcher) tossed to the
initial sack (first).”</p>

<p>“I really think some of it is too plain,” said the
Professor, rather more pleased than he would let on.
He found himself quite an adept in this new language.</p>

<p>“It improves as you go along, I think,” said Tim.</p>

<p>“Let’s see what happened in the second inning,”
went on the Professor. “Barber College goes to
bat now, doesn’t it? Amberg hit one over the shortest
route to Everson (that must be a straight-line
hit), Wheeler spun three times and sat down (spun
what? I don’t get that).”</p>

<p>“When a fellow strikes at a ball hard and misses
he generally spins around,” said Tim. “Wheeler
missed three strikes which he tried very hard to hit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“I see,” said the Professor, “and Dorner did
the same. So Black struck out two in succession,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Black (was Black the first man up?) did what
was expected of the pitcher. What is expected of a
pitcher at bat? I don’t get that.”</p>

<p>“Pitchers generally bat poorly. Black struck
out,” said Tim.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see! Gibbie is up next. Gibbie got a
one timer (that’s a one-base hit, I guess) back of
Wilson (let me see, where does Wilson play? Oh,
yes, third!). Gibbie got a one-base hit back of third
(very plain), Ross arched one to Knight (an arching
fly), Everson dropped one in front of the rubber
(a bunt, I am getting on splendidly again), Gibbie
annexing the keystone bag (Gibbie got to second),
Little Arthur was there with a dew drop (dew
drop? What’s a dew drop, Tim?).”</p>

<p>“A little fly ball that comes down out of the sky
and lights on the grass without touching anything,”
said Tim.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see! it was a little fly that should have
been caught, but no one got there in time. Wilson
picked it up too late to shut the door on either Gibbie,
Everson or Delvin (couldn’t prevent them from
what?) who slid into the vacant chairs (did he want
to shut the door on the chairs?). You used a bad one
there, Tim—and all the seats at table were occupied
(bases all full, eh?).</p>

<p>“The big German lad (Hagner) leaned gently
against the leather apple (leaned against the ball.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Do you call Hagner’s style of hitting, leaning?) and
knocked it out of the orchard (over the fence) shaking
the tree for four more juicy ones (you mean
four more runs) for Lowell. Ty fouled to Bowman.
Three out (why, such ordinary English?).</p>

<p>“After that for the third, fourth, fifth and sixth
spasms (innings) neither side got a look in (very
ordinary, Tim), although three hopefuls from each
college went boldly to the front, only to be cut down
in their youth before crossing the Rubicon (you are
giving out, Tim, this isn’t nearly so good).”</p>

<p>“Wait until you strike the music in the seventh
inning,” answered Tim.</p>

<p>The Professor went on reading, “In the stand-up
session (oh, yes! seventh inning), however, the tonsorial
artists (good! the Barbers) made the Lowell
hair stand up (I don’t get that one).”</p>

<p>“Gave us a scare,” explained Tim.</p>

<p>“Hughie sent the Infant in (Infant?)”</p>

<p>“Radams,” said Tim, “his nickname is Babe.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, the Infant,” went on the Professor.
“Hughie sent the Infant in for a piece of
pie (piece of pie, why pie?).”</p>

<p>“Well, the game was easy and Hughie wanted to
give Babe a little practical experience.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said the Professor, “very good, indeed,
we will continue. Jones the first shaver (he must
have been a Barber man) swung the sign (the
sign?).”</p>

<p>“Yes, the sign—the barber pole—the stick—the
bat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, yes, very good; swung the sign on a drop
(drop ball) and raised it over Arthur’s study box
(study box—do you mean—of course, you mean,
he raised it over Delvin’s head) for a single. The
fellow with the after 6 <span class="lcsmcaps">P. M.</span> name (let me think.
Guess you’ll have to help me again, Tim).”</p>

<p>“Read a little farther,” said Tim.</p>

<p>“The fellow with the after 6 <span class="lcsmcaps">P. M.</span> name waited
patiently, and as the Babe couldn’t see the plate because
Knight was near (oh, yes! I see his name
was Knight, very good, indeed, Babe couldn’t see
the plate, ha! ha!) he walked. Wilson hit a
slow one to Johnny which he came in on and rolled
around the sod (Everson must have fumbled), while
Jones, Knight and Wilson perched on the salt bags
(very ordinary that last), Hughie wigwagged (signaled)
the infield to come close so they could hear
the song of the Whirling Sphere and join in the
chorus.</p>

<p>“Amberg binged (must mean hit) one which
knocked the wind out of Honus’ organ (the ball
hit Hagner in the stomach, I should say, from reading
that), Johnny picked up the sphere (ball) and
heaved it at the Barber band sitting back of Gibbie,
behind the screen, to make them join the music (he
threw wild and high past Gibbie), and Jonesy and
the Utter Darkness (Utter Darkness? Oh, yes!
Knight again) beat a fast tattoo on the base line
and disappeared over the horizon to the visitors’
bench after their final journey toward the West.
(Now, if I understand that, it means Jones and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Knight both scored and went and sat down on the
bench with their fellow players. Is that the idea?)”</p>

<p>“It is,” said Tim.</p>

<p>“Well, we’d better finish this inning, anyhow.
Babe got himself in tune by this time (you mean he
got in harmony with the requirements of his job,
I suppose) and whanged out three high, but perfect
notes (he sent up three good balls), which Wheeler
tried to reach in unison with him (Wheeler tried to
hit each of them) but couldn’t (in other words,
Wheeler struck out); Wilson, who had reached third
while the loud pedal was open (let’s see, Wilson
had got to first on Johnny’s error. Then this must
mean he got around to third when Johnny made the
wild throw past Gibbie), was lulled to sleep by the
sweet strains (was so delighted that he got careless)
and was caught napping by Gibbie (Gibbie
caught him off third base), Dorner sent a whistler
(a fast one) out to Talkington who muffled it (do
you mean muffed? Oh, no, I see! he caught it
and that muffled its whistle), and the singing practice
was over. Score, 7-2.</p>

<p>“I think that is about all I can hope to learn in
this first lesson in your new language, Murnin,” said
Professor Bennett, resuming some of the dignity
which he had dropped when he had become interested.
“When I first saw this I thought it wouldn’t
do at all, but there seems to be something about this
new language of yours which makes the report of
a ball game quite interesting, and, I shall, therefore,
let the story go in the <cite>Reporter</cite>. I wish, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
that you would write out a class-room copy of the
report in plain English so that I can have a defense
handy in case any one asks questions of me.”</p>

<p>Tim did this but the report of the game as it appeared
in the <cite>Reporter</cite> was so much of a puzzle that
it created a disturbance. The principal trouble was
that the members of <a href="#image27">the faculty failed to look at the
matter in the same light</a> that Professor Bennett had,
and they decided that future games should be reported
in the former style.</p>

<small>THE ALUMNI GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Every year about this time there would be quite
a gathering at the University of old Lowell graduates.
They came to see the team work, in one or
two games and in practice, and once each year the
graduates would make up a nine of the old timers
who had come, and challenge the new Varsity to a
game. It was one of the traditions of the University
that the old graduates’ team always won this game,
notwithstanding their stiff knees, and other joints, to
say nothing of their poor throwing arms. The occasion
was more of a reunion than anything else,
generally. Yet at the same time the old fellows
were often able to give valuable pointers to the new
team, and, on the whole, aside from the fun of the occasion,
and the good it did the youngsters, it served
to bring the sons of Lowell more closely together.</p>

<p>Of course, the occasion was always too good a one
to be missed by the practical jokers, and the old graduates,
with the aid of some of the Juniors and Seniors,
always picked out the good-natured young freshmen,
to play these jokes upon. In the meantime the fact
that these practical jokes were played was carefully
withheld from them. The evening before the game,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the graduates had announced the team which would
play next day.</p>

<p>All of them were old time stars at Lowell, and
though out of the game were never forgotten by the
boys at school, because they each had a sure place in
the Lowell Hall of Heroes. The youngsters were
all on hand to see them and hear again the stories of
their remarkable playing. On this occasion there
was always a “fanning bee,” as the boys call it, and
reviews of Lowell victories of the past.</p>

<p>As Hal was on his way home alone that night,
having stayed around longer than Hans, he heard
some one following close behind him, and after he
had gone a couple of blocks someone touched him on
the shoulder and said, “Hello, Case, what’s the
hurry?” Turning round he saw that it was Johnny
McGrew, the old timer who was a great second baseman
and who was on the team which would play the
next day. After they had walked a little way,
McGrew suddenly said: “Case, I want you to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
something for me. We old fellows are no match
for the wonders, including yourself, which Hughie
has on the Varsity this year, and we’ve just got to
win to keep up the old team’s reputation. You just
write down the signals which Hughie uses, and that
will enable us to lick the spots off you. Nobody
will know about it, and I’ll see that you get a hundred
and twenty-five dollars for it.”</p>

<p>Naturally Hal became very indignant, and proceeded
to show it by preparing to fight.</p>

<p><a href="#image28">“Now don’t get mad, kid,” said McGrew.</a>
“Nobody need know. Think it over and I’ll call
around at your room in the morning and fix it up
with you.” Then without another word he turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
on his heel and went back. Hal was so mad he did
not know what to do for several minutes. His first
thought was to go back to the hotel where these old
fellows were staying and where he knew he would
still find a large number of his student friends and
denounce Johnny. Finally he thought of Hughie
and he became almost sick at the thought that anyone
would take him for that kind of a lad.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 419px;">
<a name="image28" id="image28">
  <img src="images/image28.jpg" width="419" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_160">“Now don’t get mad,” said McGrew.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“I’ll go to see Hughie and tell him all about it,”
said Hal to himself. “As they have approached me
and found I wouldn’t do what they wanted, they will
probably tackle some one else who may fall.” So he
hunted up Jenkins whom he found in his rooms with
Everson and Larke, laying out the campaign for the
game next day. By this time Hal was so angry he
didn’t wait to see Hughie alone, but blurted out his
story to the three of them. They were very much
surprised, and thanked Hal for coming to them with
the warning.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said Larke, “if that’s the way they
win from us youngsters.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with putting up a job on
McGrew?” said Everson.</p>

<p>“Say, that would be a slick idea,” said Hughie.
“I’ve got the scheme. You go home, Hal, to-night
and say nothing. When McGrew comes in the morning
you tell him you’ll do it, but that I never give
out the signals until after morning practice, and that
you will get them for him and hand them to him
when the teams are dressing for the afternoon game.
Also that he can hand you the money later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“What you really give him, though, is a blank
sheet of paper. He’ll walk off with that, thinking he
has the signals, and the real joke will be on him
and he won’t dare peep while we can enjoy it
secretly.”</p>

<p>Hal did everything as he was instructed. McGrew
called, and when Hal told him about how he would
do it he said, “That will be all right.”</p>

<p>Hal promptly met him in the dressing room and
handed him the paper at the proper time, and he
stuck it in his pocket. Hughie was, of course, watching,
but instead of laughing to himself and enjoying
the joke on McGrew he ran over, stuck his hand in
McGrew’s pocket and pulled out a paper.</p>

<p>“What are you fellows up to,” he asked, and then
he opened the paper and looked at Hal in surprise.
He started to read and his eyes bulged almost out of
his head. <a href="#image29">“Why, these are the day’s signals,” said
Hughie.</a> “What does this mean?”</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 426px;">
<a name="image29" id="image29">
  <img src="images/image29.jpg" width="426" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_162">“Why these are to-day’s signals,” said Hughie.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“It means that one youngster on the Lowell team
hasn’t stood the test of loyalty which is required of
our Alma Mater. I arranged with Case last night
to tip me off to the signals to-day in this way. I paid
him a hundred and twenty-five dollars last night,”
said McGrew.</p>

<p>“Is this true?” asked Hughie. “Did you write
this?” as he handed Hal a sheet of paper of the
same kind he had handed McGrew. Hal took the
paper and almost collapsed. On the paper was the
following written in a very good imitation of his
writing:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p2 noic">“<span class="smcap">Signals.</span>”</p>

<p>“When Hughie uses a player’s name after the
word careful, as for instance ‘Careful Johnny,’ even
though mixed up in a lot of talk from the coaching
lines, it means that the coach has discovered that the
opposing pitcher is about to throw a fast straight
ball, and Johnny at bat is thus given the signal to
hit at it.</p>

<p>“With two men on bases if Hughie raises his cap,
it is a signal for a double steal.</p>

<p>“When Hughie pulls grass with his right hand it
means hit the next ball pitched, and when he pulls the
grass with his left hand it means try to get a base on
balls. If he lifts his left foot and whistles it means
that right field is the best place to hit it, and if he
does the same but with his right foot it means that
the left fielder is out of position and the best place to
knock the ball is there.</p>

<p>“When a batter walks up to the plate with two
bats in his hand and one or more of his team mates
on base, if he throws the extra bat behind him with
his left hand, it means that he is going to hit the first
ball pitched.</p>

<p>“If he throws the extra bat away from him with
his right hand it means that he has orders to try to
get a base on balls.</p>

<p>“If Hughie, on the coaching lines, unbuttons the
top button of his sweater it means that the fellow on
first must get ready to steal second. If Hughie, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the coaching lines, jumps in the air and waves his
arms, yelling Eyah! Eyah! twice, it means to the
batter ‘Bunt.’ If he only says Eyah! once it means
hit it out as hard as you can.”</p>


<p class="p2 noic">“<span class="smcap">Catcher’s Signals</span>.”</p>

<p>“If the catcher in telling the pitcher what kind of
a ball to serve up lays two fingers of his bare hand
against the inside of his catching mitt, thumb outstretched,
he is signaling for an outcurve. One finger
means an incurve. With two fingers on the
glove, thumb turned under, a low outcurve is wanted.
If with one finger on the glove, thumb turned under,
a low curve is asked for. The whole hand doubled
up in the glove means ‘send one wide of the plate, I
have detected a signal to steal.’ Holding out the
gloved hand without touching it with the other
means send a straight ball waist high right over the
plate.”</p></div>

<p>It was an exact copy of the signals which Hughie
had given out in the morning. Hal was mad. He
never was so mad before in all his life. He was mad
enough to kill some one.</p>

<p>“I can lick any fellow that suggests such a thing,
and I am going to start in right now on the bunch
of you.”</p>

<p>The first fellow he started for was Hughie. Just
then Hughie winked at him, and he stopped and
looked at McGrew. McGrew was laughing and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
were all the rest, for by this time the room had filled
up with old graduates, and it suddenly began to filter
through Hal’s brain that this was one of those harmless
practical jokes that he had heard about. He
thought it was cruel, of course, but McGrew said he
had heard a lot about Hal and among other things
it was said that he was so even tempered that he
wouldn’t fight with anybody, and they wanted to see
what it would take to make him fight. They were
satisfied now that he could be depended upon to fight
at the drop of the bat, whenever there was anything
worth fighting about.</p>

<p>Then they showed him that each fellow on the
graduates team had a type-written copy of the signals,
anyhow, furnished by Hughie. That was one
of the rights which every player on the Alumni team
could enjoy for one day in the year. The old graduates’
club was expected always to win its game with
the Varsity, and how on earth would they have any
show against these modern Lowell teams, with their
inside baseball and their new trick plays, if they
didn’t have the signals?</p>

<p>Then they all shook hands with Hal and told him
he was a member of the “Tried and True Club” of
Lowell, and made him understand that this was an
honor very rarely given to a freshman, but that they
wanted him to have it because of the wonderful work
he was doing as a first baseman. When he shook
hands with McGrew, however, he got another
bump.</p>

<p>“Better give me back my one hundred and twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
dollars now, old boy. I suppose you have it with
you.”</p>

<p>Hal thought of his half of the story money which
had come from the magazine, and it was in his trousers
pocket that moment. Was this another one of
their jokes, and how did they know he had it, was
what he thought. What he said was, “What do
you know about my one hundred and twenty-five
dollars, brother,” and they all laughed at Hal’s quick
guess this time.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Fielder James, “you don’t know perhaps
that I am connected with the <cite>Out Door Weekly</cite>,
but the other boys do. The editor, knowing that I
was coming up here, showed me a story in a recent
issue of the magazine and asked me to look up the
author of the story, Harold Case, and arrange with
him for some more of them. I had seen your name
mentioned in the <cite>Reporter</cite> every week, but I didn’t
connect you with the author chap, because they have
called you Hal lately in the paper. So when I arrived
I was looking for Harold Case, the author. I
found only one person in the town by that name,
yourself, so I asked my friend, Jimmie Hamilton,
the cashier of the bank, to help me find the author, he
having been here for twenty years, and I told him
why.</p>

<p>“He said it must have been you, as you were in the
bank a few days before cashing a check from the
<cite>Out Door Weekly</cite> for two hundred and fifty dollars,
and dividing it with Hagner. He saw you give some
of it to Hagner, and then Hagner deposited one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and twenty-five dollars to his own credit
in the bank and he guessed you must have divided
with him. That was the first time I got the idea that
Hans might have been a real live person, because in
the college news he is of course referred to as Hagner.
We just guessed you probably had the one
hundred and twenty-five dollars in your pockets, and
so we arranged the practical joke to fit what we knew.
Now is it a real story or not?”</p>

<p>“Let’s go and ask Hans,” was all Hal would say.
When they did get to Hans they made him tell the
whole story over and McGrew said, “If you come to
New York again let me know and I’ll lend you my
auto.”</p>

<p>Hal was happy. It meant a great deal to him to
be recognized by these older graduates as their equal,
and he had a right to be happy. It was recognition
of his merit by those whose opinion was valuable, because
they had enough practical experience of the
world to enable them to recognize true worth. None
of the other Freshmen on the team were let into the
secret of how the old graduates were able to beat
them so badly. They marveled at the fact that the
old timers were on to every play that the boys attempted,
and they had a great respect for the old
crowd that licked the Varsity that day by the one-sided
score of 11 to 2.</p>

<p>But in the evening the old graduates’ club gave
the team a little dinner at which this tradition of the
university was explained for the benefit of the other
youngsters, Hans, Ty, Tris and Radams, Ross and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Huyler. Then they were all initiated into the mysteries
of the Lowell O. K. Club, which meant that
the team had been inspected by the old boys who
had won laurels for Lowell in the past, and was good
enough in their minds to go against Jefferson.</p>

<small><a href="#image32">THE MAKING OF A FAN</a></small></h2>
</div>


<p>Hiram Parker lived in the house with Hal and
Hans. He it was who had rented the third floor
room at Mrs. Malcolm’s on the same day that Hans
had moved in. He had not arrived until the day
following Hans and, as said before, prepared his
own meals in his rooms, and was such a quiet, serious
fellow that neither Hans nor Hal got very well acquainted
with him, or in fact saw him very often.
Parker was a Senior. He was well thought of in the
university, especially among the members of the
Senior Class, who knew him for his earnestness.</p>

<p>Parker was a poor farmer’s son. He had to
work harder than any other fellow in the university,
and he had to do the things the hardest way. Not
over bright naturally, he had to make his way by
hard study and he was able by the force of his will
to overcome obstacles which one with less determination
would have balked at. When he entered the
university he was thirty-five years old. He was so
poor and the little money he earned in vacation time
was really such a small amount that he had less to
spend than any other fellow in the school and he devoted
all of his time to his studies and paid no attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to the social features of college life, and very
little more to athletic affairs.</p>

<p>Shortly after the last holiday vacation he had
found himself still more cramped for funds, and finding
that Mrs. Malcolm would let him have the third
floor front room for twenty-five cents per week less
that he had been paying, he had taken her room and
moved in. His constant struggle was to be able to
live long enough to get through his course, and he
allowed himself no penny’s worth of spending money,
nor any recreation whatever. He had his mind on
the main chance all the time and for him it was to
be graduated with honors from Lowell.</p>

<p>Parker was narrow-minded then, but he became a
great preacher in later years and broadened out a lot.
His life was altogether serious, and being much
older than Hans and Hal and having undertaken to
complete the college course in three years instead of
four he was too serious even for a fellow of Hans’
disposition, who while earnest in all things, managed
to get the most out of life as he went along.</p>

<p>Occasionally the boys would meet Parker on the
way home or on the stairs. Being full of baseball
all the time, they tried to talk about it to Parker.
He would listen attentively when they showed their
enthusiasm in this way and then he’d say, “I don’t
know anything about the game, boys. Never saw
but one in my life and when it was over, I knew less
about it than before. It looks like a good game for
a lot of lunatics.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t think that way if you knew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
game,” said Hal. “Nothing like it for exercising
all the muscles and keeping you strong and healthy.”</p>

<p>“Clears your brain just to watch a game if you
understand it,” said Hans. “Rests your brain after
the hard work of study.”</p>

<p>“I never had time to rest,” said Hiram. “College
is a serious thing with me.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t pay to work all the time,” remarked
Hans. “You know the old saying ‘All work and
no play makes Jack a dull boy.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that, but I’m strong yet and I have
been rather dull all my life,” replied Parker without
noticing the humor of his remark.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you take a day off and come out and
see one of the games some day?” asked Hal.</p>

<p>“Maybe I will some day,” Parker would reply,
and would then go on up to his room.</p>

<p>But the drawing nearer of the big games of the
season caused a lot of excitement around the university,
so much, in fact, that even fellows like Parker
began to be affected by it.</p>

<p>On the day of the game with Chadwick College
which was the last game at home before the first
game with Jefferson now only a week off, Hal met
Parker coming in just as he was going out to the
grounds. Hal was not in the game that day. He
had developed a bad boil on his left hand and
Hughie wasn’t taking any chances on having that
hand out of commission a week later, by having it
further crippled.</p>

<p>So Hal was given a lay off from the team to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
his hand a chance to heal, and as he was very anxious
not to miss those great games, he made no kick against
Hughie’s orders. At the same time it was tough to
think of sitting in the stand while Hans and the
other boys were enjoying themselves in the game with
Chadwick which was generally an easy game for
Lowell to win. Chadwick College was not in the
same grade as Lowell, but sentiment for the founder,
Father Chadwick, known as the Father of Baseball,
and the memory of what he had done for the great
sport served to keep the game on the regular
schedule, and it had always taken place just before
the first great game with Jefferson.</p>

<p>“Come on along to the game,” said Hal as he met
Parker.</p>

<p>“I have a good notion to. For once I haven’t
much to do to-day. Been thinking for some time I’d
go out and see a game. I’ll go if you’ll find some one
to explain it to me,” answered Parker.</p>

<p>“I’ll explain it to you myself,” said Hal. “I’m
not allowed to play to-day on account of this boil
on my hand.”</p>

<p>“All right, then, I’ll surely go.”</p>

<p>When they got out to the grounds Hal found a
couple of seats in the stand back of first which was
his favorite place when watching a game, as from
there he could see all of it and watch all the plays.
When play started, though, he didn’t have much time
to think of the game, he was so busy answering
Parker’s questions.</p>

<p>When Parker had told him he didn’t know anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
about the game of baseball, Hal thought of
course, he didn’t mean that he knew nothing at all
about it. He supposed Parker would know what
the idea of the game was, but when Parker asked
him what they had those big bean bags out there for,
Hal commenced to realize that here was a fellow
who didn’t know as much as a girl even about the
great American game.</p>

<p>Once he had taken a girl cousin to see a game in
California, and the foolish questions she asked him
made him vow never to take a girl to a ball game
again.</p>

<p>“What has that fellow got the cage on his face
for?” was one of the first questions Parker asked.</p>

<p>“That’s Gibbie, the catcher,” answered Hal.
“He stands behind the plate and he might get hit
by a foul tip.”</p>

<p>“What’s a foul tip?” was the next question.</p>

<p>“A foul tip occurs when a batter strikes at a ball
and almost misses it. The ball just touches the
rounded side of the bat, and of course changes its direction.
It does this so quickly that the catcher sometimes
can’t see it and it might hit him on the head,”
replied Hal.</p>

<p>“I see,” said Parker. This was during practice
before the game.</p>

<p>“What’s the idea of the game anyhow?” asked
Parker next.</p>

<p>“Well,” began Hal, looking at Parker to see if
he was serious or joking. Parker was serious.
“There are nine men on each side. One side goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
out in the field and the other side is at bat. When
there are three out they——”</p>

<p>“I thought you said nine were out,” broke in
Parker.</p>

<p>“No, there are only three put out. I guess you
were thinking about what I said that one team of nine
players takes position in the field to catch the ball.”</p>

<p>“Does it take nine men to catch a ball?” asked
Parker.</p>

<p>“No, only one,” said Hal, “but they have a man
in each of the locations where the ball is likely to
be hit.”</p>

<p><a href="#image30">The people in the seats in front turned around</a> to
look at Parker <a href="#image30">to see who it might be</a>. They wanted
to see what a fellow looked like who was as ignorant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
of the great American game as he seemed to be.
Just then the game began, the umpire said “play
ball,” and after Hal had told him that the umpire
was the judge of play, Hal and Parker directed their
attention to the diamond. Presently the pitcher
threw the ball. Ross was at bat. It was a ball and
Ross didn’t strike at it.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 462px;">
<a name="image30" id="image30">
  <img src="images/image30.jpg" width="462" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_174">“The people in the stands turned around to see who it might be.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Why didn’t he hit it?” asked Parker.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t the right kind of a ball to strike at,”
replied Hal.</p>

<p>“Do they use different kinds of balls?” asked
Parker.</p>

<p>“No, they use the same ball all the time.” Hal
saw that he would have to explain about balls and
strikes.</p>

<p>“You see, a batter can get four balls or three
strikes. If he gets four balls he runs to the base.
If he gets three strikes he’s out.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t he always take the four balls?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see the pitcher fools him.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“The pitcher tries to make the batter think balls
are strikes and strikes are balls.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t the batter know the difference?”</p>

<p>“Not until the umpire tells what it is. Sometimes
even the pitcher doesn’t know if it is a ball or
strike until the umpire says what it is,” explained
Hal. He was thinking of the many times umpires
have called balls when the pitchers thought they were
over the plate.</p>

<p>“Then what’s the use of having a batter?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Parker, bringing his logic into play. “Why don’t
the batters stand up in line behind the umpire and
let him tell each one in his turn if it’s a ball or a
strike?”</p>

<p>Before he could answer, however, Ross had hit
the next ball. The umpire called “foul ball” and
the Chadwick shortstop, third baseman, and catcher
were all running to make the catch as it was a high
foul over toward the third base stands.</p>

<p>“What are they all running for?” asked Parker.</p>

<p>“To catch the ball,” answered Hal.</p>

<p>“I thought you said it only took one man to catch
a ball.”</p>

<p>Again Hal tried to explain.</p>

<p>“You see, when a batter hits the ball the fielders
try to stop it and throw it to the base ahead of the
runner. If the ball gets there before the batter, he’s
out. If he gets there first he is still in the game.
The player who throws to the base is credited with an
assist, or a put out if he catches the ball before it hits
the ground.”</p>

<p>“But why doesn’t the batter run if he hit the
ball?”</p>

<p>“Foul ball,” said Hal. “A foul ball, that is a
ball which strikes the ground outside of those white
lines” (pointing to the foul lines left and right)
“doesn’t count as a hit. For a hit, a ball must be
fair, which means striking inside those lines. A foul
ball counts as a strike, but if it is caught it’s an out.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Parker.</p>

<p>The game had meantime proceeded. Ross had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
three balls and two strikes. The pitcher sent up the
deciding one. “Four balls, take your base,” called
the umpire. Ross walked down to first.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t he run?” asked Parker.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t have to run,” replied Hal.</p>

<p>“But you said if he got four balls he could run
to first base.” This showed Hal that Parker was
absorbing the points and he took some encouragement.</p>

<p>“They usually let them walk on four balls, as he
can take his base on a walk by the time the pitcher is
ready again,” he replied. By this time Ross had
reached first and was standing there with one foot
on the bag.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t he take the base if it is his?” was
the next question.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t really take the base,” explained Hal.
“He is simply entitled to go to it and be ready to
run to second base.” He saw that he would have to
be very careful in his choice of words if he was to
teach Parker much of the game. Everson was next
at bat. He hit the first ball for a long fly to left
and started on a slow trot toward first, while Ross
remained at the bag.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t the fellow on first run?” asked
Parker.</p>

<p>“He is waiting to see if the ball is caught,” said
Hal.</p>

<p>“Can’t he run unless the ball is caught?” Parker
went on.</p>

<p>“Not on a fly. He has to wait until the ball is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
caught. After a fly is caught he can run to the next
base.” The fielder muffed the ball and Ross ran
like the wind to second, Everson reaching first easily.</p>

<p>“I thought you said he couldn’t run until the ball
was caught. That fellow out there missed it,” came
from Parker.</p>

<p>“I ought to have told you at first that if a fielder
muffs a fly ball everybody runs, except in the case
of a foul,” explained Hal.</p>

<p>“Yes, but there are only two of them running,”
Parker replied.</p>

<p>Hal laughed. Everybody near them was paying
more attention to them than to the game. They
were calling Parker “the Rube.” One freshman
said: “Get a copy of the ‘Book of Rules,’
Rube, and learn it by heart before the next
game.”</p>

<p>The game proceeded for some time and Hal did
the best he could to answer the many questions
Parker put to him. He had his own troubles when
it came to explaining the “hit and run play,” “the
double steal,” and the “squeeze play,” especially the
latter. Some one in the stand said when Ty was on
third base and Tris at bat with one out, “They’re
going to work the squeeze.” They did work it, and
successfully, as sometimes happens, and the fans
yelled, “Did you notice that squeeze?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see anybody get squeezed,” said Parker,
“who was it?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Hal, “Ty was on third and Tris
squeezed him in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did he hurt him?” asked Parker.</p>

<p>The crowd around them yelled. Hal knew it was
almost as hard to describe the squeeze play as to
justify it, but he did his best and Parker said finally
he understood it all right, but it is doubtful if he
really did.</p>

<p>The game had developed into a really exciting one
for an inning or two. For the first few innings the
pitchers had held the batters safe and there were few
hits made. In fact, up to the beginning of the
seventh inning Lowell had secured but three hits and
Chadwick three. Lowell had one run, worked out
by a two bagger by Robb, a clean steal of third and
he had been brought home by Tris on the squeeze
play already mentioned. In the first half of the
seventh, Chadwick knocked out three runs on a couple
of hits mixed with a bunch of errors on the part of
Lowell.</p>

<p>In the meantime by repeated explanation of the different
plays, Parker had begun to understand some
of the first principles of the game. He had already
gotten to the point where he didn’t ask as many questions.
He was watching the game. Six short innings
of baseball had planted the seed out of which
would some day grow a “full fledged fan.” He
didn’t understand much of it, of course, but he had
begun to feel the alternate strain and relaxation which
everyone feels when watching a game. It has been
the same for years with all of us.</p>

<p>When “our” side is at bat you are always hoping
the batter will hit it safe. You watch the pitcher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
wind up. Your muscles are tense. You see the ball
leave his hands. You see the batter prepare to strike
at it. He strikes and misses. The umpire calls
“one strike.” You relax. Again the pitcher delivers
the ball. Again the muscles become tense.
The umpire says “one ball” and again you sink back
in your seat in perfect repose. By this time the
pitcher is again ready. The third time the ball is
sent toward the batter like a white streak. Somehow
you feel he is going to hit it this time. As before,
your muscles become tense. You hear a crack
of wood against leather. You raise yourself up in
your seat. It’s a foul fly back of the plate. You
see the catcher throw off his mask and run up for
the ball. You are absolutely rigid. You see the
set and determined face of the catcher as he comes
running toward you, his mind on nothing but the
catch he hopes to make, he sees nothing but the ball.
You, yourself, are thinking of nothing else. You
hope he misses it. Now it’s coming down close to
the stand. He’s almost under it. He’s going to
get it. Just then he stubs his toe on a pebble and
he muffs it. You are glad. You relax. You cheer
him for missing it. You look round you. There
are ten, twenty, forty thousand people, a moment ago
just as tense and rigid as you, thinking of nothing else
but that catch, who are now settling back in their
seats, happy and content, everyone of them, excepting
of course the few “rooters” for the other side.</p>

<p>The next ball pitched is a good one, fast and
straight over the plate. The batter sets himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
meet it fair and square. You do likewise, as if you
would help him. Now he pulls back his bat, he
swings, he meets it fair, you can tell by the sound it
makes that it’s a long hit. You see the center fielder,
look once to get the direction, then turn his back to
the ball and run just as hard as he knows how. You
stand up, everybody stands up, not a word is spoken.
It seems as though minutes are passing until the play
is decided. Soon you see the fielder turn half way
round to look and then he goes on running. He is
still too far away. You see him getting near the
ball, but not near enough to catch it. By this time
the ball is going over his head. He has lost it. No,
he makes one try at the right moment. He takes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
mighty leap into the air, up goes one hand, the ball
hits his glove and sticks, <a href="#image31">he comes down to earth</a>, he
rolls over half a dozen times on the grass, but he
comes up finally with the ball in his hand and you
begin to relax. Then you start to jump up and down,
you wave your hat, you throw it up in the air, and
wave your arms and you try to yell louder than your
neighbors. If you look around, you will see forty
thousand people doing the same. Yelling and cheering
and waving arms, hats or anything that comes
within reach. You are cheering the other side, but
you don’t mind. It was a wonderful catch.</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_182">“He comes down to earth.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>And so it goes, through nine whole awfully short
innings always. Time flies so quickly at a ball game.
It’s over before you want it to be. Our side wins!
You go home happy. Our boys lose? Well, better
luck to-morrow.</p>

<p>In the second half of the seventh inning of the
game with Chadwick, this Lowell team just had to
get at least three runs, so Hughie told the boys and
he would be obliged if they would get a half dozen.
Everson was the first man up and he got an infield
hit to short which he beat by inches. Then the
Lowell boys on the bench commenced to get busy, for
they had sensed the “break.” There comes a time
in almost every game of ball, which has become
known as the “break,” when the game can be won
for one team or the other. There is no definite
period of the game when this occurs, but the players
seem to sense it. Let a batter get to first and if you
see the players on the bench commence to reach for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
their bats, swing them a few times, laugh, get excited
and dance up and down like boys with a new
toy, you will know that the “break” has come then,
and that the game will be won or lost right there.
So it was at this point in the game with Chadwick.</p>

<p>Delvin was the next man up. He got a single to
right field. Next came Hans. He hit a grounder
over second base which couldn’t be stopped and the
bases were full. Ty came up with his little black bat
and hit the ball over third base for a two bagger and
Everson and Delvin raced home for runs. Hans
got to third and Ty reached second. Tris knocked
the ball to shortstop, who was nervous by this time
and made an error. Hans got home and Robb
reached third while Tris was on first. One more
run. The Larke hurried to the plate and after fouling
off a couple, hit one fair and square and the ball
made a high flight straight for the left field fence,
and went over. A home run, and Robb and Tris
scored ahead of him. The “break” was over, the
opposing players settled down. The pitcher steadied
himself, recovered his nerves, and the next three men
went out in order. The rest of the game went along
without any further excitement. The “break” in
the seventh inning was the meat of the whole game.</p>

<p>Parker and Hal went through the inning like all
the rest. It got so exciting for Hal that he forgot
all about Parker and when he did remember him he
saw that Parker had forgotten him. Parker was
standing up on his seat with all the rest of them,
bareheaded, for his hat had been discarded many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
minutes before. His hair was disheveled, his coat
was in his left hand and he was whirling it above
Hal’s head while with his other hand he was slapping
his neighbor on the right violently on the back
with a newspaper, while that party was hugging the
fellow in front of him.</p>

<p>“I see you have joined the ranks of the lunatics,
you told me about the other day,” said Hal.</p>

<p>“Me for the ball game after this,” replied Parker.
“Think of it. Here it’s my first game of ball since
I came to college, nearly the last game of the year,
and me a Senior. I’ve been asleep. I’ve missed
things.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way it gets everybody,” said Hal.
“It surely is the great American game.”</p>

<p>Parker was sorry when the game was over. It
was a great experience for him, and during the remaining
few days of the term he had many talks
with Hans and Hal about baseball and after he was
graduated and became a famous preacher he became
and remained a faithful enthusiast. Thus are
“fans” made.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>THE TRIP TO JEFFERSON</small></h2>
</div>


<p>During the second week in June, the week of final
preparation for the trip to Jefferson and the first of
the three championship games with Jefferson, final
examinations interfered to some extent with the baseball
practice, but by getting out on the field very early
in the morning and late in the afternoon, with here
and there a special shifting of the examination hour,
for this or that member of the team, the nine put in a
pretty busy week.</p>

<p>Coach Young had returned from Jefferson with a
complete confirmation of the early reports about the
nine that Captain Church had developed in the western
college, and letters kept coming in daily from
alumni in the west, sounding the warning that
Hughie and his boys must “prepare for the battle
of their lives,” as Church had built up a wonderful
baseball machine—one that it would be the greatest
task to beat.</p>

<p>This talk had its effect on the Lowell boys, and
Hughie and Captain Larke were a good deal worried.
After a consultation they decided to telegraph
to Johnny McGrew, Conny McGil and Pop Anderson
to come on to act as assistant coaches and help
put on the finishing touches. Most of the time was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
put in signal and batting practice, as all other games
were out of the way. The coaches figured that with
equal ability in the pitching department the batting
would win the games, if backed up by perfect team
work, which only a thorough understanding of the
signals could make possible.</p>

<p>Finally the great day came for the trip to the
western college. A special train of twelve cars was
provided and with the cheers of all of the students
that couldn’t go along, professors and the townspeople,
ringing in their ears, they started.</p>

<p>The team occupied a special coach in the rear of
the train, and no one not a member of the Varsity
was allowed in the car, excepting of course, special
coaches, Young, McGrew, McGil and Pop Anderson.
With these surrounding them in the car,
Hughie, Captain and Johnny laid out the plan of
the coming battle.</p>

<p>They had their own private chef aboard, the same
who prepared the meals at the training table, so that
with the exception of riding across the country at the
rate of sixty miles per hour, they were as comfortable
and fully as much under training orders as at home.
The other cars on the train were occupied by the
great body of students who made the journey with the
team to attend the game, three coaches being filled
with the Lowell Organized Noise Club. All along
the route, whenever the train stopped, and they made
stops all along the line to take on Lowell Alumni—there
were crowds of Lowell graduates at the station
to cheer and wish them Godspeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>We will turn our attention, however, to the special
car at the end of the train with the nine.</p>

<p>There is nothing like a long railroad journey to
get you acquainted with people and to give you a
chance to note the peculiarities of the others in the
car and this would be especially true in the car referred
to where everyone was interested in one thing.
Every man on the train felt that the result might depend
upon him. The good batters would wonder if
their favorite sticks were aboard.</p>

<p>Ty Robb, quiet and nattily dressed, high strung,
nervous, built like a greyhound, with slight waist and
magnificently formed shoulders, small ankles and
wrists and a poise to his head like the ideal Grecian
youth, came as near being a perfect built athlete as
any one on the train; but even this well-balanced
youth was not above being superstitious, for he got a
little bit nervous along about bedtime, and finally
hunted up his little old black bat out of the bunch and
took it to bed with him.</p>

<p>Hans, directly opposite in temperament, ponderous
in his movements, anything but nervous, but
equally superstitious, saw Ty coming down the aisle
with his bat and went him one better, for in addition
to getting his favorite bat, he dug out his old glove—the
one with the hole in the middle—and slept that
night with it under his pillow.</p>

<p>Captain Larke had no superstitions to bother him,
nor was he nervous. His responsibilities as captain
of the team never in any way interfered with his
playing. His movements were always graceful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
he had an eye that was particularly clear when it
came to judging the speed of baseballs knocked out
to left field. One habit, however, of college boy life,
the captain never would acquire. He was born in
Kansas and ever since he could remember he had
owned a big cowboy hat and the college boy’s cap
was so insignificant by comparison that he never
would wear one of them. Larke’s hat was a kind
of mascot with him, no doubt, for he always kept it
on such trips as this where he could keep his eye on
it when not on his head.</p>

<p>Johnny Everson, small in physique, but large in
brains, self-possessed and confident at all times, had
made one of his nice little speeches to the boys at
dinner, and when he went to bed he wasn’t thinking
about bats, balls or gloves or worrying about the
part he might have to play on the morrow. He lay
awake in his berth a long time, however, rehearsing
the impromptu speech he intended to make at the
dinner which he knew the Jefferson boys would give
the team whether the game was won or lost.</p>

<p>Hughie had a good many things to think about so
he didn’t get much time to let superstition work.
He was busy with his batting order and signals for
the coming game, but just before going to sleep he
did wonder if the grass at Jefferson was longer and
thicker at third base or at first.</p>

<p>Delvin, like a number of the older fellows on the
team, had made the trip before and was not unfamiliar
with sleeping cars. Delvin was a grand fellow
almost all the time, quiet, and a great reader and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
he rarely ever kicked about anything. But put him on
board a sleeper and along about bedtime you could always
hear him grumble, and no wonder, for there
never was a berth made long enough to accommodate
all of his length, and so he had to curl up when he
slept on a train and during the night Arthur woke up
the whole bunch several times with his grumbling.</p>

<p>Gibbs, big, strong, and brainy as lots of these boys
are who came from Canada, was pretty tired from
the long ride with no activity, and at bedtime went
to bed and to sleep with no apparent thought of the
hard work before him the next day. But during the
night he must have dreamed about a ball game, for
suddenly the whole car was aroused by the noise of
breaking glass and some one was shouting, “<a href="#image33">You will
try to steal on me</a> will you?” and when the boys
stuck their heads out from between the curtains they
saw Gibbie in one end of the car in pajamas over
which he had put on his shin guards, pad, mask, and
glove and at the other end of the car could be seen
a badly shattered mirror through which Gibbie
had just a moment before thrown something.
He had been walking in his sleep, and putting on all
of his catching outfit had for five minutes been making
signals at himself in the glass at the other end of
the car. Thinking he saw a base runner, he picked
up what he thought was a ball (it was in reality one
of Hans’ big shoes), and snapped it at his own image
in the mirror beyond. He missed the porter, who
happened to be coming down the aisle just then, but
made a perfect throw and the shoe went sailing into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the mirror. They finally managed to wake him up,
but had a hard time doing it, for Gibbie kept saying,
“Don’t put me out of the game. I want to catch
every game on the schedule this season.”</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_189">“You will try to steal on me?”</a></div>
</div>

<p>For Hal the trip was a great novelty. He and
the other freshmen had never taken a railroad ride
in a private car, and it was a great novelty for them.
The ovations the boys received at the different stations
were particularly interesting and at most every
station the Alumni and friends of Lowell, after
shaking hands with the old boys on the team and
wishing them good luck, would always ask, “Where’s
Case? We want to see Hal and Hans, also Robb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
and Talkington.” Between stations he read a few
short stories for boys as he was always interested
in them. Hal was not known to be superstitious
and did nothing on going to bed that would show that
he was, so it is impossible to write down anything
about him here along this line. Hal, however, did
wear his cap on the train and just before he went to
bed he took a wad of chewing gum out of his mouth
and stuck it on the button on the top of his cap.
There may have been no superstition connected with
that, however. He probably only wanted to put it
where he could find it.</p>

<p>Huyler, the utility and pinch hitter, got a new nickname
on that ride. They called him the “Candy
Kid.” No one knows who started it, but the idea
may have been suggested by the numerous confectioners’
signs which dotted the landscape all along the
route, and particularly those of one manufacturer
whose goods were continually offered by the newsboys
on the train.</p>

<p>Black, whose youth was spent in the coal districts
of Illinois, was happy because he was on his way to
his own state, and whenever they passed a trainload
of coal on the way, he would tell the boys what a
great business coal mining was. You would not
think he would have much love for coal or the mines
either, for as a boy he had lost two of the fingers of
his right hand by getting his hand caught in some
machinery at one of the mines near his home while
playing around it. But Miner always said that if
he had more than three fingers left on his pitching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
hand he probably could not throw the kind of curves
which he did, but would have to pitch the same as
others, and he probably wouldn’t amount to much as
a pitcher if he did.</p>

<p>For Babe Radams the ride was one of doubt. He
wanted to get into the game the next day but only
an accident to Miner would give him a chance, and
he thought very likely that he would have to sit on
the bench. He wouldn’t think of hoping that
Miner would have to be taken out of the box, but he
felt confident that he could take care of the job if he
got a real chance, and perhaps they would let him
pitch the second game, if Lowell won the first.
Babe’s thoughts were, however, all for the glory of
Lowell and so he really wished that it wouldn’t be
necessary to call on him during the first contest. He
had acquired a good deal of glory as second pitcher
on the team and felt sure that next year he would
be the first pitcher for the team, since Miner would
be out of school.</p>

<p>Before one o’clock, however, all the excitement
had settled down in the car and everybody was
asleep. Gibbie had forgotten his troubles and Delvin
had quit grumbling, and the rest of the boys were
glad, so they slept on undisturbed until the porter
awoke them about seven in the morning and told
them they had arrived.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>BEFORE THE BATTLE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>When the boys awoke to find themselves in the
western city, the seat of Jefferson College, a great
crowd was on hand to meet them. They were
mostly Lowell Alumni who lived in the towns in the
West. Many of them had traveled hundreds of
miles to attend the game, and win or lose, cheer for
Lowell. A number of the members of the team
were greeted at the station by their fathers and
mothers and sisters who had not seen the boys since
the holiday vacation. Then there was also a fair
sprinkling of sweethearts to greet them.</p>

<p>There was nobody to meet Hal, for his folks
couldn’t afford to come all the way from California.
His father’s illness, however, had not been serious
and he had gone back to his work and was thus able
to send Hal his original allowance, so the boy’s worry
about money was over. In fact, he had money in
the bank, for Hans had a long talk with Hal after
the Alumni game, and had convinced him that it
would be a good time to show a little thrift, so
Hal had put his one hundred and twenty-five dollars
in the bank, and Hans had gotten him to agree not
to touch it until it was absolutely necessary. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
never had a bank account before and he was proud of
it, now that he had started. He had not written any
more stories for the <cite>Out Door Weekly</cite>, because Hans
had made no more trips to New York.</p>

<p>Seeing most of the fellows talking to parents, sisters
or sweethearts gave Hal a touch of homesickness,
but it was not for long, as presently the whole
team was gathered into a half dozen waiting automobiles
and driven through the streets and out to the
Jefferson Club House, which was within the grounds
occupied by the Stadium. Here the boys could bathe
and limber up during the morning hours for the
game, which was to begin at two o’clock.</p>

<p>On the way to the club the automobiles made a
detour of the streets, including a trip past the college
buildings and the fellows had an opportunity to get
an idea of the extent and grandeur of this wonderful
western college. There were quite as many buildings
as at Lowell, and they were much finer in many
respects, but the newness did not make you think of
classic halls and college traditions as did the old ivy-clad
buildings at Lowell. In years to come this
might possibly be said of Jefferson, but it takes time
to build up a college and only age can bring to it
the loved traditions such as were associated with
Lowell, and the boys were glad that they were enrolled
as students in the older and more famous university
of the East.</p>

<p>Jefferson College had been founded but twenty
years before. A very rich man had endowed it with
millions and added more millions every year. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
best teachers that money could secure were obtained
and the college had done remarkable things for the
boys who entered it, but no amount of money they
could spend could give that which Lowell had spent
more than a hundred years to acquire—recognition
as the greatest seat of learning in the country. But
the western college was proud of the remarkable
progress she had made in so short a time and she
was reaching out in every way, hoping that some day
she would overtake and pass her great rival.</p>

<p>Naturally athletics was selected as one of the
chief fields of effort. Her managers knew that
athletic supremacy would give the college the greatest
prestige. Championships in the different branches
of sport would attract students, and with a full roster
of students, year after year, it was thought to be
only a question of time when all the rest would come
to her.</p>

<p>So they had built a magnificent athletic field costing
over a million dollars, the finest equipment in the
country. There were enough seats to accommodate
50,000 people, and every seat was taken at the big
games which took place there, for the people of this
Western city were proud of their college, as they had
a right to be, and they made up attendance what Jefferson
lacked in alumni, and they “rooted” just
as hard for their college as they would have had
they graduated from the beautiful though as yet
not classic halls.</p>

<p>The rivalry between the two schools was therefore
keen, even though one was, in baseball at least, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
defender and the other the aggressor. Lowell came
to Jefferson as the recognized champion in both baseball
and football this year and of two teams evenly
matched, Lowell would have the slight advantage
which champions always have and her games were
usually conducted with this advantage in mind.</p>

<p>Jefferson on the other hand had still to win the
championship and was fighting hard for a reputation.
She was inclined to conduct her games desperately,
to try by the force of brawn to overthrow
the champions.</p>

<p>For this reason the annual struggle over the Baseball
Championship stirred up a lot of excitement and
this excitement was felt throughout the city.</p>

<p>On the day of the great game, business houses
closed early and everyone talked baseball. Everybody
that could get in went to the game. Many
were always turned away, for even the vast amphitheater
seating fifty thousand was not big enough.
After all the seats had been filled and ten thousand
others were let on the field to sit on the grass or stand
for two hours through the contest, the gates would
be locked and no more could get in.</p>

<p>Long before ten o’clock the streets surrounding
the field were crowded with people standing in line
hoping to get one of the choice seats, many of which
were not reserved. At eleven o’clock the gates were
thrown open and for more than an hour the people
poured into the grounds in a steady stream. By
12.30 the stands were full and ten thousand or more
had been let out on the field below the stands to sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
in cramped positions on the ground or stand with aching
legs through the great game. If anyone in that
crowd got tired standing, he didn’t show it.</p>

<p>At one o’clock the two teams emerged from the
club house to make the annual march across the
field to the benches reserved for players. They were
preceded by a band of sixty pieces. Jefferson College
wore white uniforms and maroon stockings and
sweaters, Lowell wore gray uniforms and green
stockings and sweaters, for the home players always
wear white. As they came marching across the field,
both teams abreast in one single line, the crowd in
the stands arose and began to cheer.</p>

<p>Hal and Hans looked ahead of them at the thousands
who had been crowded out onto the field.
Neither of them had ever before seen such a crowd
to say nothing of playing ball before so many people.
In two thirds of the stand, from the extreme left way
over almost to the visitors’ bench, nothing could be
seen but a mass of white and maroon. Back of third
base from where they approached, the maroon gave
place to green. As they came nearer they could see
the white places represented white shirt sleeves or
ladies’ dresses or straw hats. The maroon they saw
was the color of Jefferson in the form of thousands
of flags, banners, and handkerchiefs, while the green
on the left was caused by the green of their own
university proudly worn by more than ten thousand
Lowell men. On the field the crowd was mixed,
maroon and green and white, for here there were
no reserved spaces. Each had to shift for himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and in the effort to find the best place to see the game
and have the most possible fun, maroon mixed freely
with green even before the game began.</p>

<p>Down in front of the Jefferson players’ bench sat
the Jefferson Singing Club which led the singing and
yelling for the Western school, while in front of the
visiting players’ bench near third base could be seen
the Lowell Organized Noise Club.</p>

<p>As they approached the home plate, the Jefferson
team turned to the left and the Lowell team to the
right and after the teams had reached their respective
benches the Jefferson Singing Club arose and placing
their megaphones to their lips began singing</p>

<p class="noic">“<span class="smcap">Fair Lowell</span>.”</p>

<p class="noi">Gradually the volume increased as the first base
stands took it up, and as the Lowell students and
adherents recognized the first notes of their dear old
College Song, they quickly joined in and sixty thousand
voices were singing in one chorus. As soon as
the song was finished the singing coaches started the
Lowell yell; for several minutes the familiar</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, just as the last echoes were thrown back
from the distance, the Lowell boys, not to be outdone
by the delicate compliment of their rivals of their
own accord also, struck up the Jefferson song,</p>

<p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Alma Mater</span>.</p>

<p>More quickly than before it was taken up by the
vast audience, because they were now on the alert,
the band joined in and for five minutes more the resounding
notes of the Western song were thrown
upon the air from sixty thousand throats to be followed
by the familiar Jefferson yell, which made the
biggest noise of all because more of the crowd were
familiar with it.</p>

<p>Then for the forty minutes of practice allowed
the team, the Jefferson crowd, the band and Lowell’s
representatives in turn sang their best songs, and
gave their yells, all but the band, of course, which in
this instance made less noise and also less music than
any one of the three, if you can ever call noise music.</p>

<p>Jefferson would start her baseball song going to
the tune of “Maryland, My Maryland.”</p>

<p>Presently the chosen umpires, Sel. O. Lafflin of
American College and Robert M. S. Lee, of National
University, came onto the field. They consulted
with Hughie and Church, agreed upon the ground
rules, and presently Lafflin, who was to umpire behind
the bat, stepped to the plate and then turning
to the stands said:</p>

<p>“<a href="#image34">Ladies and Gentlemen: The batt’ries for to-day’s
game are—</a>For Lowell, Black, pitcher and
Gibbs, catcher. For Jefferson—Mellen, pitcher and
Brest, catcher; Black and Gibbs for Lowell; Mellen
and Brest for Jefferson. Play ball.”</p>

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_202">“Ladies and gentlemen! The batteries for to-day are——”</a></div>
</div>

<p>Quickly the Jefferson players arose from the bench
and trotted out onto the field. The Lowell boys on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
their bench stirred nervously, eager to get into the
fray. Everson carefully selected his favorite bat
from the row of them which was on the ground before
the bench and stepped to the plate.</p>

<p>There wasn’t a sound to be heard on the grounds
or in the stands. Everywhere was silence. Mellen
stood there in the pitcher’s box, the new white ball
in his right hand, eying Everson with intense scrutiny,
trying to solve what his greatest batting weakness
might be. Everson looked back at Mellen,
waiting, perhaps a little nervous but with a look of
determination on his face. He stood at the rubber,
his feet slightly apart, his bat firmly grasped, his
head to one side as if listening, but his eye on the
white round thing in Mellen’s hand, and he never
took his eye off that ball. The game was about to
begin. The first ball pitched might decide the game.
His turn at bat if successful might win it, his failure
to do just what Hughie had instructed him to do
might lose the game. Mellen began to wind up.
He pulled back his right arm, twisted himself, looking
back of him; he turned back again facing the
batter; he brought forward that strong right arm of
his, the ball started toward the plate, a white streak.
The game had begun.</p>

<p>“Ball one,” called the umpire as the first ball released
by Mellen sank into Roger’s big mitt, and
the crowd settled itself temporarily to watch the big
battle. Mellen had sent up a wide one just for a
feeler and Johnny let it go by. The second ball cut
the plate in the middle, but Johnny never made a
move.</p>

<p>“Strike one,” said the umpire.</p>

<p>Everson struck at the next one only to foul it off
over the stand and it was two strikes and one ball.
Mellen quickly sent up a good one guessing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Johnny would be looking for a ball, but Everson
saw it was going to be good and took a hard swing
at it and met it squarely, knocking a very fast
grounder over second base which looked good, but
La Joy of Jefferson hurried over, made a very graceful
reach with his right hand, and turning, threw,
without looking, straight to Church, and Johnny was
out by a foot. One out. The crowd sat up, for it
was a hard ball to field, although Larry made it look
easy.</p>

<p>Larke was the second man up. He fouled off
the first two balls offered to him, let one pass for a
“ball,” and as the next one seemed to be coming
where he liked it, swung hard at it and missed.</p>

<p>“Out,” said the umpire and Talkington trotted
up to the plate.</p>

<p>He hit the first ball pitched far out to right field
but Mellen had motioned the fielders to play back and
the ball went straight into Twitchell’s hands for the
third out.</p>

<p>The sides now changed places amid the cheers of
the crowd, for the game promised to be particularly
interesting.</p>

<p>Laird, the first man up, after missing one, hit a
pop foul over by the Jefferson bench which Delvin
caught after a quick run.</p>

<p>Beach drove a hot grounder to Delvin, who made
a fine stop and throw to Case and there were two out.</p>

<p>Captain Church of Jefferson was next up. Miner
sent one of his fast inshoots to cut the inside corner
of the plate, but it was a little wide and as Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
couldn’t get out of the way, the ball grazed his shirt
and Church got his base.</p>

<p>Hollins was next at bat, but Gibbie got the idea
that Church would try to steal second right away, so
he motioned Miner to send up a fast wide one.
Church tried it but was caught a dozen feet off the
bag by Gibbie’s perfect throw to Everson.</p>

<p>In the second inning Robb was first up. He
struck hard at the first ball pitched, and missed.
Then he bunted the next ball, but it rolled straight
to Mellen and he was an easy out, Mellen to Church.</p>

<p>Then Hagner came up for his first turn at bat.
The Lowell crowd began a great noise of cheering,
for they had a feeling that something would happen
now. They had long been in the habit of expecting
action in the game when Hans came to bat. But
Hans showed no signs of excitement as he walked to
the plate. He stood there in his loose, awkward
way, studying Mellen, and Mellen was studying him.
Perhaps Mellen had better thoughts than Hans, for
he served up a ball that looked good to Hans and
he struck at it hard and missed. The second one
looked just as good and he missed that one too.
When Mellen delivered the next one, Hans thought
he would look it over carefully and if it looked like
the other two he would let it go by. It did look
like the others, coming straight for the plate, and
so he waited for it to curve, but it came straight over
the plate and Hans didn’t move, but the umpire said,
“Three strikes. Batter up,” and Hans had struck
out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Hal now came up. There were two out and he
wanted a hit. The second ball looked good, so he
hit it for a grounder to the right of Laird and raced
to first, but Laird made a stab, got the ball, and without
setting himself, made a very quick but low throw
to Church. The Jefferson Captain, however, made
a beautiful pickup and Hal was out.</p>

<p>Now it was the second turn for Jefferson at bat.</p>

<p>Hollins without waiting drove a hot grounder
right over first base that looked like a hit, for Hal
was playing about twenty feet off. Somehow or
other, however, Hal got over near it, threw himself
the last six feet of the way, stopped the ball while
falling and then, as he lay on the ground, tossed to
Miner, who had covered first, for a put out. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
rest of the Lowell team looked pleased, for he had
saved a hit and the crowd was excited. The Jefferson
boys couldn’t figure how they could get hits when
such fielding was possible.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 484px;">
<img src="images/image35.jpg" width="484" height="600" alt="“Easter egg”" title="“Easter egg”" />
</div>

<p>At any rate they all thought this but Larry. He
walked up to the plate and stood there swinging his
bat carelessly. Wherever Miner pitched a ball,
Larry would reach up or down with his bat and touch
the ball somehow. He fouled off one after the other
until he had lost seven balls over the stand behind
him and then he hit the eighth one fair and square
for a long liner to center which ought to have been
good for a double, only Talkington raced over and
by extremely fast fielding held it to a single.</p>

<p>The seven fouls and the hit by Larry had made
hard work for Miner and so when Warcford came
up for his first time at bat he hit a Texas leaguer to
short left which fell safe and he took first while Larry
reached second.</p>

<p>It looked as though Jefferson would score surely,
and especially with Twitchell at the bat and runners
like Larry and Warcford on the bases. It looked
even more dangerous when Twitchell hit the first ball
Miner pitched for a very fast grounder right over
second, but Everson raced over, made an almost impossible
stop, tossed the ball to Hans on second who
relayed it to Case at first completing a fast double
play and letting Miner out of a dangerous hole.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of the third inning. So far
Jefferson had the better of it, two hits, while Lowell
hadn’t had a man on base.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Arthur came to bat and struck out. So did Gibbie
and when Black came up Mellen made it a strike out
for the side, for he got Miner, too.</p>

<p>Lowell took the field for the second half of the
third and Miner proceeded to repeat Mellen’s stunt.</p>

<p>Brest was the first up and Black undertook to fool
Roger, who, however, while pretending that he was
going to strike by running out to meet the ball, completely
fooled Black, and so Roger got his base.
Big Mellen, the pitcher, tried to bunt, but Hal who
was expecting this had started for the plate on the
run the moment Black started to pitch. The bunt
started for the first-base line and Roger started for
second, but before the ball had rolled three feet Hal
had it. He tagged Mellen out and whirling quickly
threw to Everson who almost missed because it was
done so swiftly. However, he caught the ball and
tagged out Brest as he started to slide. The play
saved a run, for Laird, the next man, drove a single
to left and Brest could easily have scored from second
but for the wonderful double play started by Hal.
Of course Laird got to first, but the players all relaxed
a little after the exciting play and Laird walked a
few feet off the base, when Gibbie caught him napping
by a quick throw to Case, and there were three out.</p>

<p>Jefferson had come a little closer to scoring in the
third. Lowell was fielding all right but they had not
gotten a hit.</p>

<p>Everson came up first in the fourth, and you could
see by his expression that he meant to change things.
He got a near hit. But for Hollins it would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
been a single, but Hollins robbed him by a great stop
on his left side and threw to Church, and Johnny
was out. Larke also got a near hit, a two-bagger
had not that big Twitchell turned it into an out after
a long chase. Then Talkington hit a dandy liner
about five feet over La Joy’s head, apparently, but
Larry leaped up and caught it and Lowell again went
to the field without a hit.</p>

<p>In their half, Jefferson broke the ice. Little
Tommy Beach opened the inning with his regular
two-base hit past third, the kind no fielder can get.
Captain Church didn’t wait for more than one ball
to be pitched. He hit the first one hard—a bounder
to Hans, who threw to Delvin, and Beach was out.
With Church on first and Hollins to help him they
worked the hit and run, Church getting to third and
Hollins to first. One out and men on first and third.</p>

<p>A run was almost certain, especially with Larry up.
He made good with a long fly to Talkington, who
made a great catch and a fine throw to the plate, but
<a href="#image36">a perfect slide by Church made it impossible</a> for
Gibbie <a href="#image36">to tag him</a>, and the score was 1 to 0 and two
out, with Hollins on second and Warcford at bat.
Sam drove a long liner to left center, and Larke starting
with the crack of the bat got it after a hard run
and the inning was over.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 438px;">
<a name="image36" id="image36">
  <img src="images/image36.jpg" width="438" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_210">“A perfect slide by Church made it impossible to tag him.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>In the fifth inning Lowell didn’t get a hit, but did
get two on base. Robb first hit a grounder to
Church but was out, Church unassisted. Hans, taking
time to study Mellen’s curves, walked. Hal hit
a grounder to Hollins, who fumbled and both runners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
were safe. Lowell now had men on bases for the first
time and were where Jefferson was in the fourth inning,
but Delvin hit a fly to Beach and Gibbie struck
out, so Lowell did no better than Jefferson in their
first effort with men on the bases.</p>

<p>In the Jefferson half, Twitchell bunted, and Delvin,
just to even up things, fumbled the ball. Brest
bunted toward first, but Hal again fielded perfectly
and throwing to Hagner, forced Twitchell. Then
Mellen singled to center and Talkington’s throwing
arm came into play, for he caught Roger trying to
get to third by a fine throw to Delvin. Laird rolled
an easy one to Hagner and was out at first.</p>

<p>In the sixth, Hughie told the boys they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
have to show something or their chances would
dwindle. He told Black to get on if possible but
the best Black could do was to hit an easy roller to
Mellen, who threw him out at first.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Hughie, “we don’t expect
pitchers to tire themselves out running.” Then he
signaled Everson to try to get a base on balls.</p>

<p>Johnny let the first one go by. “Strike one,” announced
the umpire. “Ball one,” he said as the
next one came over. The third ball looked good,
but Johnny had been told to wait it out and the umpire
announced “Strike two.” The next one sent up
by Mellen was intended to fool Johnny. It was all
but over the plate but Johnny didn’t move. “Ball
two,” said Lafflin. The fifth one was just like the
last one, and the umpire shouted “Ball three” and
the Lowell rooters began to hope. It was now three
balls and two strikes. The next ball would be the
important one. On it came, almost waist high. It
looked like a strike, sure, and Johnny was about to
hit at it when suddenly it began to drop downward
and before it had hit the ground in front of the
plate (which it did do) Johnny was off to first for
he knew it was a ball.</p>

<p>Captain Larke walked up to the plate with a confident
air.</p>

<p>“Now’s the time,” shouted Hughie from the
coaching line. “You can do it, Fred,” he continued.
“Make it a two-bagger while you’re at it and we’ll
only need one more.”</p>

<p>Fred nodded in reply and then as the ball sped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
toward him he swung hard for a two-bagger to left
center that brought Johnny home with the tying run.
Talkington had the fever by this time. He came to
bat and let two go by, but the third he hit for a
mighty drive to center.</p>

<p>With the crack of the bat Little Tommy Beach
started for the fence, running as fast as he could and
never once looking back at the ball. When he got
to the fence he turned quickly, raised his hands about
as high as his head and caught the ball as easily as
though he had been standing there watching it all the
time. He himself couldn’t tell how he knew just
where that ball would drop, but everybody knew he
had robbed Talkington of a home run, and Larke
had to hustle back to second for he had been so
sure that it wouldn’t be caught that he hadn’t
waited. That catch by Beach was enough to stop any
one from trying to knock the ball over the fielders’
heads.</p>

<p>Robb must have thought so, anyhow, for he hit
one on the ground to La Joy, who made easy work of
getting it to first ahead of Ty. The score was tied,
and it had looked a moment ago as though one run
would win the game.</p>

<p>Now it was Jefferson’s turn to go out in one, two,
three order. Beach fouled out to Gibbie, Church
struck out and the best Hollins could do was to drive
a long fly to Ty, out in right field, of which he
made an easy catch.</p>

<p>In the seventh inning Hans drove one to Hollins
and was retired on an easy throw to Church. Hal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
bunted and was again thrown out by Mellen, and
Delvin flew out to Twitchell, so there was little
chance for Hughie to get excited on the coaching
lines. For Jefferson it was almost the same, La Joy
went out, Hagner to Case. Warcford hit a high
one which Johnny got easily. Twitchell’s was an
easy grounder to the box and he was thrown out at
first.</p>

<p>When the eighth inning started, however, there
was a feeling throughout the crowded stands as
though something were going to break. One felt it
in the air. The Lowell players were mildly excited.
The feeling was shared by Gibbie, who was first to
bat. Hughie felt it was then or never and said:
“It’s up to you, Gibbie,” and Gibbie stood up to the
plate as though he meant business. The first ball
pitched he hit for a foul. The next one was called
a strike, the third was a ball and the fourth Gibbie
rapped for a clean single to right.</p>

<p>Black came up and immediately sacrificed Gibbie
to second. By this time the players on the beach
were jumping up and down, much excited, picking
out bats. They had sensed the break and they each
hoped the fun would last until it came their turn at
bat. But it was hardly a real break, and the enthusiasm
died down some when Everson stepped to the
plate and knocked a high foul which Laird held after
a wonderful catch close up to the stands, but Larke
again came to the rescue of the base runner and on
a long single to left along the foul line brought
Gibbie home. Talkington then tried again to put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
one over Tommy Beach’s head but Tommy made
another of those circus catches and the side was out.</p>

<p>Then for Jefferson it began to look like defeat, for
Black tightened up and struck out Roger on three
pitched balls only one of which the latter struck at;
Mellen hit one but Delvin stopped it nicely and threw
wide to Case, who made a one hand stop, and Black
got Laird on three strikes.</p>

<p>In the first half of the ninth Lowell tried hard to
add another run and came near doing so. Robb
drove a single far out to left center which Warcford
fielded beautifully after a long run and threw to
La Joy in time to catch Ty sliding while trying to
stretch it into a two-bagger. Hans drove a single
to right and then Hal came up for his last time at
bat. On the hit and run he drove a grounder between
short and third which Hollins fielded beautifully
but threw poorly to Church, and Hans continued
on to third while Hal remained on first and
Delvin came to bat. The hit and run had worked so
beautifully that Hughie decided on a double steal.
Hal started for second and drew the throw, and Hans
led off third, but big Mellen intercepted the throw and
Hans was caught after practically the whole Jefferson
team had chased him up and down the line between
third and home, while Hal got around to third.</p>

<p>It was now up to Delvin to make a hit if the run
was to count and he made a good try with a long
liner to left center, which both Beach and Warcford
went after. Warcford being taller was just able to
touch the ball by leaping as it went over his head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
It looked good for a muff, but <a href="#image37">Beach</a>, near at hand
by this time, made a quick jump to the right as the
ball was partly stopped and deflected in its flight by
Warcford and <a href="#image37">turned a sure error into</a> an assist for
Sam and <a href="#image37">an out</a> for himself by his quick catch for
the third out.</p>

<p>Lowell was through and the game was theirs if
they could hold Jefferson for another inning.</p>

<p>The Jefferson crowd started their continuous cheers
as Beach came to the bat for the final half. Black
studied him carefully. Beach’s fielding had been
wonderful and all of the Lowell boys were calling
“get this first fellow; if you can stop him the game’s
ours.” Black determined to make a supreme effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
to strike him out. The first ball Tommy let go by
and the umpire called “strike one.” The next one
he struck at and fouled off. “Strike two.” The
next two were balls and the fifth was wide of the
plate, but Tommy struck at it and he was out.
Church came up and hit the second ball. It was a
fast grounder to the left of Everson. He made one
of his famous stops and tossed to Case for the second
out.</p>

<p>Hollins came up and hit the second one far out
over Talkington’s head and it would have been a
homer but for Tris’ fast recovery and fine throw.
Church, coaching now at third grabbed Eddie as he
was going past third in an effort to get home and
pushed him back to the base or he would have been
out. He thought Larry, who was next up, would
be likely to get a hit—at least it was the better chance
to take.</p>

<p>It looked as though the score might be tied, and if
it hadn’t been for the fact that Warcford and Twitchell
both followed La Joy, it might have resulted
in a deliberate present of a base on balls to Larry.
Black, indeed, did pitch two wide ones to tempt
Larry to strike, but he didn’t bite. The next one
Larry was also going to let go past, but as it came
straight over he struck at it and went out in Ty’s
territory far over his head.</p>

<p>It looked like a sure home run also, and Larry was
on his way to first when the ball struck foul by not
more than two feet, so he had to come back and Hollins
returned to third. Miner sent up another wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
one, but Larry reached out with his bat and sent it
out to left field along the foul line and was again near
first when the ball hit the ground foul by not more
than a foot. So he had to come back again. By
this time Black had decided Larry’s eye was too good
and undertook to give him a base on balls. He did
give him another ball, and tried to send up a fourth
one, but Larry reached out again, gave it a quick tap,
and it was a foul fly which came down in Hal’s mitt
very close to the bag, and the game was over.</p>

<p>It had been a hard game to win and might easily
have been won by either side.</p>

<p>Almost every man on the Lowell team had saved
the game by excellent work at one stage or the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and the boys knew that the luck of the game had as
much to do with their victory as anything. They
knew now that they were up against one of the best
teams of ball players that could possibly be brought
together, and no one could say which was the
stronger of the two. If the luck of the game should
desert them in the next two, the result might easily
be in favor of Jefferson. The championship was
really in danger.</p>

<p>Hughie congratulated all of the boys on their excellent
playing, and while none of them had done
very much with the bat for they had been opposed
by a wonderful pitcher, it was satisfaction to know
that Jefferson had just as hard a time trying to hit
Miner.</p>

<p>He was particularly pleased with the fine fielding
displayed by the youngsters Hans, Hal, Ty, and Tris,
who had stood staunch under the first big firing, but
what pleased him more than anything was that the
old stand-bys like Larke and Everson and Gibbie had
been responsible for the actual runs and he felt pretty
confident of the final outcome.</p>

<p>Church, of Jefferson, on the other hand, got his
encouragement out of the fact that his team had
played fully as well as Lowell, and with a little luck
would have won. A little less wind when Larry got
a foul instead of a homer in the ninth would have
given them the game, and he told the boys he felt
sure the luck would average up, and that the championship
would be won this time.</p>

<small>RETURNING HOME</small></h2>
</div>


<p>At midnight the Lowell special started on the return
trip, with another special train, bearing the
Jefferson team and her faithful rooters, trailing them.</p>

<p>The celebration after the game had been glorious
but pretty strenuous, and the boys were tired. They
all tumbled into their berths and went promptly to
sleep.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, however, they were awakened
by the noise of cheering, and looking out of the
windows of the car they could see they had stopped at
a station crowded with people. It was hardly six
o’clock, but the platform was crowded with an enthusiastic
mob, giving the Lowell yell and calling on
the boys to get up and show themselves. The train
pulled out before they could do this, but they got up
and dressed and had an early breakfast.</p>

<p>Then they prepared themselves for the all-day
ride to the East. Presently they stopped again. A
still larger crowd was at the station with the familiar
green flags and banners. This time the boys went
out on the platform and joined the chorus of Lowell
songs and yells.</p>

<p>So it went all day. Wherever they stopped there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
were cheering crowds and songs and yells. Every
once in a while they called on Hughie for a speech
and he would do his best in reply. It was almost
the kind of a ride which the President makes on his
occasional swings around the circle. Certain it is
that no President ever got a more enthusiastic reception
than did the Lowell boys that day.</p>

<p>During the course of the morning when there was
about an hour’s run to the next stop, Johnny Everson
and Arthur Delvin found Ty Robb in the far
corner writing busily.</p>

<p>“Writing to the folks?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p><a href="#image38">“Don’t bother me,” said Ty</a>, “I have an inspiration.”
So they left him alone, but presently he came
up to where Hughie, Larke, and Everson were sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and talking things over, and said: “I’ve made a
brief report of the game for the boys at home. I
saw a peach back there at the last station, and whenever
I see peaches I think of ’Gene Field’s little
poem.” Then he started to sing.</p>

<p>As Ty sang the other boys gathered round him
and as most of them knew the tune they were presently
crowding close, looking over his shoulder at
the words and joining in. Then they made copies
of it and sent them by the porter into the other cars
of the train. Pretty soon everybody on the train
either had a copy or had learned the thing by heart
and whenever they stopped at a station they would all
get out on the platforms or lean out of the windows
and introduce the new song to the crowds at the
stations, always leaving a few copies behind. By
the time they reached Lowell, early in the evening,
Robb’s doggerel song had been sung from Cleveland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
to Lowell and found its way the next day into most
every big paper in the country, so that almost every
Lowell man in the land knew it within twenty-four
hours after it was composed.</p>

<p>Presently the train pulled into the station at
Lowell. The boys looked out at the mob that was
there to welcome them. Hal and Hans thought of
the former return to Lowell when Hans had brought
him back. This was a different kind of home coming.
There was no walking or riding in carriages
that night. It was shoulders for the team, surely,
and they prepared for it.</p>

<p>The crowd at the station was singing the Lowell
songs and yelling and cheering, but presently as the
team and the others on the train appeared, the latter
began singing Robb’s “Peach Song” again, and the
crowd stopped to listen. They heard it, they seemed
to drink it in, they learned it all at once, it seemed,
for presently they were all singing this rather dirge-like
chant of a Lowell victory.</p>

<p>Hughie tried his best to get the team away from
the crowd, for they had a hard game ahead of them
next day, but he gave it up finally, saying only, “All
right boys, do as you please with us but don’t
hurt us; we’ve got to lick them again to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Then <a href="#image39">they grabbed Hughie, lifted him upon strong
shoulders</a>, corralled the rest of the boys in a similar
way and through the streets of the old college town
they took them, a happy, joyous procession, the band
in front playing, and the horns blowing. Finally
they were let go to their homes where they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
get another refreshing sleep in preparation for the
second and perhaps final struggle which would take
place on the morrow.</p>

<p>The crowd that welcomed Jefferson, which arrived
an hour later, was not so large but it gave them a
rousing welcome just the same. They knew that Jefferson
had fought hard and bravely, and it had been
no easy task to beat them; but Lowell had won, and
they could afford to give the losers a generous welcome.
They let the Jefferson team ride in carriages,
however, contenting themselves with singing a few of
the Jefferson songs, mingled with their own loved
ones. They didn’t sing Ty’s “Peach Song” but Jefferson
had heard it all along the route and they were
determined to make Lowell sing an entirely different
one before another twenty-four hours had passed.</p>

<small>DISTINGUISHED FANS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The day of the second of the big games broke clear
and warm. The same excitement was to be noticed
around the old college town as on the day of the
first game at Jefferson. Lowell, however, was not
located in so large a city, and therefore the people
who had come to the game were more noticeable.
Special trains from Boston, New York, and other
points began pouring their loads of Lowell and
Jefferson rooters into the old station before nine
o’clock in the morning, and the steady stream of
arrivals continued until game time, which was again
two o’clock. For the early arrivals time might have
hung heavy on their hands had they not found a
chance to let off some of their steam, by parading
the streets, and singing the old college songs.</p>

<p>A procession of Lowell “rooters” would march
up one street singing “Fair Lowell,” while down
another street would come the Jefferson crowd,
though smaller, singing their “Alma Mater.”
Whenever they met there would be a great mingling
of college yells, which didn’t sound nearly as well
as when they were separated and which, to anyone
without the college spirit probably sounded as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
a lunatic asylum had been turned loose upon the
town. But nobody without this college enthusiasm
could be found that day at Lowell, so the boys and
girls paraded up and down the streets to their hearts’
content, and finally took up the march in the direction
of Lowell field, where the same scenes took place
which had been seen at Jefferson on the day of the
first big game. The band played for the entertainment
of the crowd. Noise clubs led the yells and the
songs, the crowd joined in, and thus they entertained
themselves until game time.</p>

<p>Around the public square, and more particularly
in front of Lowell Arms, the most popular hotel in
the town, was assembled a great crowd, and only
a championship ball game itself could have kept the
guests of this inn from being the center of the
universe on this day, for the President was to arrive
during the morning and the hotel was already filled
with Senators, Representatives, Ambassadors and big
politicians, who are likely to hover around the
President on such occasions, to let some of the
reflected glory shine upon them.</p>

<p>Many of them came for the sole purpose of seeing
the ball game, but others, who are playing the
political game all the time, hoped to catch the President’s
ear during his visit.</p>

<p>When the President did arrive and was welcomed
by such enthusiasm as the townspeople, students,
and visitors could spare from the baseball game, he
turned a deaf ear to anyone who had anything to
say on any subject but baseball and college life. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
was bound to be a boy again whenever he came to
Lowell and the annual games were his special
delight.</p>

<p>Out at Lowell field they had arranged a special box
for the President and other distinguished guests,
which he occupied for a little while, but when it
came time for practice he said, “It don’t seem quite
like a ball game sitting here. I’m going over there
and sit with the boys.” And he did. They made
a place for him in one of the seats in the first row
of the regular grand stand, where the sun could shine
on him, and when he got warm he took off his hat
and coat just like any other fan, and enjoyed himself
to the limit.</p>

<p>Lowell field was not as new and substantial a place
as the Stadium at Jefferson, but the stands would
hold almost as many people, and the grounds, being
larger, more standing room was found on the field.</p>

<p>By one o’clock every inch of space was occupied
and the gates were locked. Never before had so
many come to see a game at Lowell. This time,
however, the Lowell folks outnumbered the Jefferson
adherents. To-day more than two thirds of the
people waved green flags and banners and the balance
showed the colors of the rival school. The complexion
of the crowd was reversed. Some who had
been at the other game wondered if this was a sign
that the score would be reversed, too. Jefferson
fellows, who were just a little bit superstitious hoped
so, while the Lowell crowd said they didn’t believe
in superstitions of any kind. Finally the teams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
marched onto the field, the University Band
preceding them, but this time as they reached the
plate, it was the maroon which sat on the bench back
of third base, and the green went back of first.</p>

<p>“We licked them when they had the advantage
of being on their own lot,” said Fred Penny who was
sitting in the stand with Johnny King, “and I guess
now we have them on our own lot, we will make it
two straight.”</p>

<p>The practice before the game gave the crowd a
chance to pay their particular respects to the
individual members of the team, by special songs
and cheers for each of them. The band played “Hail
to the Chief” once for the President and two or
three times for Hughie. Then each member of the
team was introduced to the President, and as each
member of the team came up the Noise Club
announced:</p>

<p>Here he is—HONUS.</p>

<p>What’s the matter with HONUS?</p>

<p class="noi">And then everybody would sing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For he’s a jolly good player,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he’s a jolly good player,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he’s a jolly good player,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Jefferson can’t deny.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And they gave a special yell for each of the particular
stars of the first game. It was enough to make
any player nervous and anxious and it’s a wonder
it didn’t. What it did do, however, was to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
every one of the boys take a special vow to play the
game of his life that day.</p>

<p>Again the two men in the blue suits and blue caps
trotted out on the field. Again the umpire, who was
to work behind the bat (this time it was M. S.
Lee), consulted with Hughie and Church. The
gong sounded. The umpire said, “Play ball.” The
Lowell boys trotted out onto the field to their positions.
Again the umpire took off his cap, faced the
stands and said:</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen: The batteries for to-day’s
game are Cam, pitcher; Brest, catcher for Jefferson.
Radams, pitcher; Gibbs, catcher for Lowell.
Cam and Brest for Jefferson. Radams and Gibbs for
Lowell—Batter up.”</p>

<p>This time Laird of the Western school stepped
quietly to the plate. He looked at Radams and
Radams looked at him. Each was studying the other,
though to-day Radams had a little advantage. He
had seen Laird at bat and Black had gone over
the other game carefully with him so he knew something
about each of the batters. At least he was
sure he did have a slight advantage, and so he did
not hesitate an instant, but began to shoot them over.
The second big game was on.</p>

<p>When the teams lined up at Lowell for the second
game, the batting order was the same but there was
a somewhat different air to be noticed among the
players. The boys who hit the ball were not satisfied
with their batting records in the first game, and
they were determined to knock somebody out of the
box. This time it was Jefferson’s first turn at bat,
and as Laird came up Radams prayed for a little
luck to enable him to get a good start. Thinking
about it so much spoiled his control, for when he
had pitched six balls the count was two and four and
Laird was walking down to first as a result.</p>

<p>Beach was true to his first inning record and got
a nice single to right field and Laird got to third.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Captain Church came up with lots of confidence and
tapped the ball smartly, but it was an infield fly which
Everson caught near the pitcher’s box. Radams was
having a hard time with his nerves, apparently, for
he gave Hollins four bad ones in succession and he
walked to first also. This brought La Joy to bat
and he hit a fast grounder over second, but <a href="#image40">Hans
made a one-hand stop</a> right at the bag, touched second
forcing Hollins and threw to first for the third
out.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 467px;">
<a name="image40" id="image40">
  <img src="images/image40.jpg" width="467" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_232">“Hans made a one hand catch.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Let’s do something in the first inning besides
field,” said Hughie, as Everson started for the plate
with his bat.</p>

<p>“Here goes,” said Johnny. Cam, the pitcher,
was sizing up Johnny and also wishing, as had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Radams a moment before, for a little luck in getting
the first man. When he pitched the first ball, however,
Everson waded right in and turned it into a
single to right and was off for first like a streak.
Larke immediately hit a low roller to La Joy who
got the captain at first, but Johnny had reached second
before Larry had stopped the ball.</p>

<p>Talkington, after getting two strikes and three
balls, hit an easy fly to Twitchell in right. Cam
was willing to let Tris hit it, but he was trying to
make him hit it in the air, and Tris did; but when
Cam pitched the same kind of a ball to Robb, Ty
rapped it for a long triple out over Warcford’s
head, scoring Everson. Hans got a base on balls
and stole second; then while Cam was winding up
to pitch to the next batter, Ty started for home, but
Roger tagged him easily this time as he was
attempting his great slide, and the side was out.</p>

<p>Warcford was the next man up for Jefferson. He
struck at the first ball Radams pitched and it went
over Delvin’s head for a neat single. It surely
looked as though there would be some hitting. Twitchell
next up, struck at the first ball and missed
and Delvin played out so as to be able to stop
anything that came like Warcford’s hit of a moment
before, but Twitchell bunted the next ball toward
third, so Delvin couldn’t get it in time to catch either
runner, and they were both safe. Then Brest sacrificed
and Warcford and Twitchell perched on third
and second respectively. Cam struck out, but Laird
singled to left, scoring Warcford, and Twitchell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
tried to get home too, but was caught at the plate
by Captain Larke’s beautiful throw to Gibbie.</p>

<p>In the Lowell half, Case was first up and the best
he could do with Cam’s curves was to hit one of them
to Hollins who fielded it in time to get Hal at first.
Delvin drove a long fly to center, but Beach got it.
Gibbie put new hope into the inning by doubling to
left center, but Radams struck out.</p>

<p>Beach was up again in the third, and Radams
tempted him to miss three, and he was out of the way.
He had almost as good a time with Captain Church,
who hit the third one on a line into Robb’s hands
out in right. Hollins, however, drove a single over
the first bag which was fair by inches, and La Joy
came up. This time Radams decided on a base on
balls after getting Hughie’s signals from the bench
and it went through all right; but before Warcford
got a chance at a good one Hollins undertook to
steal third and was caught by a quick throw from
Gibbie to Arthur.</p>

<p>Everson went out on a good stop by Cam which
he tossed to Church at first. Larke tried to put
one between Beach and Warcford in left center, but
it went a little too high and Beach got it easily.
Talkington bunted along the first base line and was
safe, but would have been out if Church hadn’t
expected it would roll foul, for he could have easily
thrown Tris out to Cam, who covered first. The
Lowell boys were looking for something good from
Robb, but the best he could do was to hit one in the
air out Twitchell’s way and it was an easy catch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>When Warcford came up first in the fourth,
Hughie signaled the outfield to play way out. He
motioned a second time to Robb and he went almost
out to the fence. Warcford noticed this and thought
if he could drop a short fly in right field it would
drop safe. The ball came to him just right, and
Hal noticing where Ty was playing started after it,
but presently he saw Ty coming full speed ahead and
knew that Ty had a chance for it, so he stopped.
Just as the ball was about to hit the ground Ty stuck
out both hands and got it and then turned two somersaults
on the grass—one of which he couldn’t help.
Twitchell drove a single between Everson and Case
which Ty fielded, and Roger hit the first ball with a
mighty swat on a line straight to Everson, and
Twitchell was doubled off first before he could even
try to get back.</p>

<p>Hans first to bat in the Lowell half of the fourth
picked out a nice spot in left field, and placed a neat
single where Warcford couldn’t get it. Hal, under
instructions, made a sacrifice bunt and was out at
first, Hans taking second. Arthur got three balls in
a row and it looked as though Cam was going to
walk him, but the pitcher fooled him by putting the
next two straight over and then it was strike out or
hit it. Arthur did his best and struck out, but while
he was doing this Hans made a clean steal of third,
to the great surprise of the Jefferson team and especially
Roger Brest the catcher, who didn’t even throw
to catch Hans. Having in mind Gibbie’s double in
the second inning Cam gave him a base on balls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Radams then made a good effort to get a hit, but the
ball went to the pitcher’s box, so Cam got credit for an
assist and the side was out.</p>

<p>Cam was first up for Jefferson in the fifth. He
struck at the first one that Radams pitched to him.
The second ball the umpire called a strike and Cam
bunted the third one and was out. The Lowell boys
and rooters got a good deal of amusement out of
this, but anyone is liable to make a mistake of this
kind. It, however, gave Lowell the edge on Jefferson
for that inning. Laird, next up, drove one to Hans
which almost knocked him down. Hans tried to
throw it just as hard to Case, but threw it high and
Hal had to jump for it, which he did, and saved
Hans an error.</p>

<p>Beach let one strike be called on him, and then he
banged into the next one for a hit to left center that
hit the fence and was an easy triple. In fact, it would
have been the easy homer which Beach tried to make
out of it but for the wonderful relaying of the ball
by Captain Larke and Hans. Hans ran out into left
field and caught the ball as Larke threw it to him
and turned, without looking, and threw it straight
to Gibbie at the plate who didn’t have to move his
hands an inch to make the catch and who tagged
Beach not over six inches from the plate. If Hans
had stopped before making the throw to get his
direction, Beach would have been safe, but he couldn’t
have made a more perfect throw even if he had
looked. It was the greatest play of the game so far.</p>

<p>In the Lowell half Johnny hit a grounder to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Church who was playing back on the grass and the
two had a foot race to first, Everson sliding feet
foremost. It looked to many as though Johnny beat
Church, but the umpire waved him out, and after
a few remarks Johnny stuck his chin in the air a little
higher and walked to the bench.</p>

<p>Captain Larke came up determined to make up
for what he thought was a poor decision, and placed
a neat single over second base, which rolled to center,
and stole second on the first ball pitched, Brest’s
throw being a little late and high. Tris felt like
doing something, but his best effort was a foul fly
in the direction of the bleachers near third base which
nobody had a right to get, but which Laird got just
the same after a long run and a beautiful catch.</p>

<p>Ty Robb now came up, swinging three bats. Larke
was on second and watching Ty closely, as the hand
with which the batter threw away the extra bat was
a signal which gave the runner the tip on what his
instructions were, but Ty was carrying three bats, and
three bats had never been included in the signal list,
so Larke was puzzled. Just because he was puzzled,
perhaps, he thought this signal might mean steal
third, so he started to do so. Ty saw him and tapped
the ball for a bunt toward third and beat it out
while Larke perched safely on third. Hans then
came up and singled to right, scoring Larke, but Ty
tried to get to third on the play and was caught by
a fine throw from Twitchell to Laird.</p>

<p>Church started the ball rolling in the sixth by an
easy grounder to Everson who fumbled, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Jefferson captain was safe. Hollins bunted along
the first base line, but Hal was on his job and fielded
the ball quickly to Hagner, forcing Church. La Joy
then dropped a beautiful single to left and Hollins
had to stop at second, making runners on first and
second. Warcford drove a low liner between first
and second and La Joy started toward second. The
batted ball hit him on the left foot and rolled into
Hal’s hands.</p>

<p>La Joy was out on this play, of course, and Hollins
had to return to second. Twitchell now came up
and hit the third ball pitched for a two bagger to
right center, which Robb received and threw to the
plate, but Hollins and Warcford scored, and Twitchell
went to third on the throw in. He overslid the bag,
however, and was out when Gibbie snapped the ball
to Delvin, who tagged him before he could recover.
Hughie sent Miner out to warm up.</p>

<p>Case put up a foul back of the plate and Brest
caught it near the screen. This was close to the
box in which the Vice President and the notables were
sitting. “He has it,” said some one, as Roger made
the catch. The Vice President turned to see who had
spoken. “What kind of baseball talk is this? Say
‘he’s got it’ not ‘he has it.’” Delvin hit a grounder
which struck Cam on the leg and glanced off in the
direction of the first base, where Church picked it up
and touched the bag for an out. Gibbie tried to get a
base on balls but was called out on strikes.</p>

<p>Brest was the first batter in the seventh. Babe
managed to give Roger a base on balls. Cam sacrificed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
him to second and Laird, the third batter, hit
sharply to Hans who threw to Delvin and caught
Brest. Beach, the next batter, gave the signal to
Laird for the hit and run and worked it successfully
and then also tried to work the double steal. They
were unsuccessful, as Laird was caught at the plate
by quick work between Everson and Gibbie.</p>

<p>In the second half, with the crowd standing,
Huyler, the pinch hitter, went in to bat for Babe and
drove a long fast liner to right which Twitchell
caught after a great run backward. It should have
been a triple, at least, but the way these two teams
were fielding it was almost impossible, seemingly, to
drive the ball out of their reach. Everson went out,
pitcher to first, and Larke also was out by way of
shortstop to first.</p>

<p>Black in the eighth inning went in to pitch
for Lowell. Church, first up, was easy for Everson
and Case and then Case and Black attended to
Hollins.</p>

<p>La Joy walked to the plate and stood there swinging
his bat carelessly and easily. Finally Black,
after looking him over, pitched a ball that cut the
plate and before Larry hit it, Miner knew part of
what would happen. When he saw it leave the bat,
however, and heard the crack he knew that ball was
headed for outside and sure enough it was. It went
over the center field fence ten feet high and never was
found. Larry simply jogged around the bases while
Lowell’s hopes seemed to be dashed to earth. Sam
Warcford took encouragement from Larry’s swat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
but his hit got no farther than Delvin, who threw
him out at first.</p>

<p>Hughie put some ginger into the boys at this stage
of the game. “They’re only two runs ahead and
we’ve often made six in one inning,” said he as
Talkington walked to the plate. Tris did his part,
and drove a single to right which might have been
a two bagger but which Twitchell fielded perfectly,
and Tris went back to first, when Twitchell threw
to second. Then Ty bunted to the pitcher’s box and
Cam fumbled, and both Tris and Ty were safe, Cam
was clearly going up and the Lowell rooters were
doing all they could to help him.</p>

<p>Hans came up and Church walked over to the box
and tried to give Cam a chance to cool off a bit by
talking to him and instructing him also to give Hans
his base. Cam pitched two balls very much to the
right of the plate from the catcher’s position which
Hans couldn’t have reached with a twelve-foot bat,
and then Hans jumped to the other side of the plate
and started to bat left handed so as to reach the balls,
but then Cam put the next two very much to the left
of the plate and there was nothing for Hans to do
but walk to first. There were now three on bases
and Hal was up.</p>

<p>Here was the first real chance he had had in either
game to show what he could do with his bat and
everybody else had been hitting Cam so here was
his chance. Just then, however, Captain Church
waved to Cam with his right and motioned to Mellen
with his left and Cam left the box and Mellen went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
in. “Well,” thought Hal, “Mellen probably isn’t
very well warmed up and he ought to be able to hit
now.” The first two balls pitched were bad ones and
were so called by the umpire.</p>

<p>“Just let him put one over,” said Hal to himself,
“and I’ll put it over the fence.” But Mellen wasn’t
pitching that kind of a ball just then. The third ball
pitched Hal struck at and missed. The next one was
straight over but looked high, and the umpire called it
a strike, at which the stands roared in rage. The
next one was a pretty good one but Hal took a chance
and let it go by and the umpire called “Ball three.”
It was now two strikes and three balls, and Mellen
decided to put the next one over and take a chance.
It came straight for the plate; Hal took a mighty
swing at it and the ball started on a line for second,
but Mellen stuck out his right hand, knocked it down
and threw to Brest in time to force Talkington at
the plate. Hal’s chance was gone. He would have
made good only Mellen didn’t mind taking a chance
with his pitching hand. Most pitchers would have
preferred to sidestep the danger. There were still
three on base and Arthur was at bat. He got three
balls and two strikes on account of fouls, and then
Mellen gave him one where he could hit it but it
was a pop fly which fell into Hollins’ mitt and there
were two out. It was now Gibbie’s chance to save
the game, but Mellen’s pitching was too swift for him
until he also had three balls and two strikes and
then he knocked a long fly to Warcford and the inning
was over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>Black gathered himself together for a mighty
ninth inning effort. He felt sure of the fielding of
the boys behind him, but he made up his mind to
take as few chances as necessary. So he decided to
strike out the side if he could, and after he had succeeded
in doing that with Twitchell and Brest, he had
a lot of confidence in his ability to do the same to
Mellen, and he did it.</p>

<p>The last half of the ninth opened rather well for
Lowell. Black was the first man up and he fooled
the entire Jefferson infield by a perfect bunt which
put him on first. This surely was a good start.</p>

<p>Everson, however, waited too long. He let two
strikes be called on him, and they were good ones,
too. The third one looked good also and Johnny
struck at it and missed and there was one out. Captain
Larke then knocked one down the line toward
Church and the latter tried to complete the out
unassisted, but Larke beat him to the bag and Black
reached second. Tris knocked a slow rolling grounder
to Hollins and by the time he got to it he could only
catch Tris at first, for Black had reached third and
Larke was at second.</p>

<p>Robb came to bat feeling good. He was to have
his great chance after all. Two men on bases and a
single would tie the score. He even allowed himself
to remember that a homer would win the game for
Lowell. Mellen on the other hand realized his great
chance. If he could outguess Robb this time there
would be a game to Jefferson’s credit. His was the
first move and he tried to tempt Ty with a ball, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Ty let it pass. Then Mellen tried him with another
one of the same kind, thinking, perhaps, Ty would
bite on the second one, but he just waited.</p>

<p>The next ball came straight over the plate and
Ty hit it and it went sailing out over first base, a
fast liner that didn’t stop till it hit the fence, but
it was like La Joy’s ninth inning hit in the first game,
only longer, for it struck the fence two feet outside
of the line and the umpire said, “Foul one strike.”</p>

<p>The next ball also came straight and Ty thought
to fool them by bunting. He did, and almost perfectly,
as the ball didn’t roll over six feet in all. Black
was nearly at the plate before Ty got started to first
but as hard luck would have it the last foot of the
distance the ball rolled outside the foul line and it
was “Two strikes” and everybody went back to
where they were before. Then it was a study to
watch Mellen and Robb.</p>

<p>Would Mellen send another one straight over and
try to make him think it would curve or would he
send one up wide of the plate and make it curve
in, or would it be a high one that would drop to the
strike level at the plate? It was a great guessing
match that lasted for several seconds.</p>

<p>Then slowly Mellen began his wind up. The
ball started for the plate. It was coming straight
over. Was it possible that Mellen had decided to
take a chance on his hitting it safe? Ty thinks he’ll
fool him on that. He will just put that ball over the
fence. He pulls back his bat to meet it squarely.
He makes a savage swing at it and listens for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
crack of the bat. Instead he hears a thud—and Ty
knew he had struck out, and the game was lost to
Lowell by the score of 4 to 2.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>HANS’ SECOND TRIP TO NEW YORK</small></h2>
</div>


<p>For the second time in the history of the contests
between the two big schools each had won a game
and it was necessary to play a third game to decide
the championship. To provide for such cases they
had a rule that where a third game was necessary
it must be played on neutral ground, the location
to be agreed upon by the captains. This was
generally done by tossing a coin. The winner had
the right to name the place.</p>

<p>This was a very important matter to decide in such
a simple way, as the team securing the choice of
location for this game also secured sixty per cent of
the gate receipts after the expenses were paid, the
money all going of course to the athletic fund. You
would think that this arrangement and the attractive
feature of the gate money would cause the boys to
try to break even on the first two games every year,
but the fact that this was only the second time in
twenty years that it occurred goes to show how square
the games were.</p>

<p>When they came to toss the coin this time Hughie
called, “Heads,” and heads it was. He promptly
said, “We will play it at the Polo Grounds in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
York,” and Mr. Williams, the treasurer of the
university, immediately arranged the matter by
telegraph.</p>

<p>This suited both teams very well. They would
break training immediately after the game and the
long strain would be over, whichever team won the
final game. The game would be played on Thursday,
and they could take Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to
have a look at the big city, and victors and losers
would be royally entertained by the alumni of both
colleges who lived there.</p>

<p>So they arranged for the reception of the team’s
return to take place on the following Monday evening
and everybody hoped and believed they would come
back as champions again.</p>

<p>The Jefferson team meantime were hailed as
friends and were given morning practice privileges
on Lowell field and treated right royally so far as
the training rules would permit. They got very
well acquainted during the four or five days they
spent together, and the old timers on both the teams
regaled the youngsters with tales of the thrilling
plays that had occurred between Jefferson and Lowell
teams of the past. Most of them had been told many
times at each school, but repeated under such conditions
were doubly interesting.</p>

<p>During one of these fanning bees the talk as usual
turned to famous fielding stunts, and many stories
were again told of famous fielders and the baseball instinct.
“I think the greatest fielder who seemed to
have this instinct,” said La Joy, “was Hugh Duff. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
have seen him a score of times out in our sun field
catch the ball by instinct after losing it in the sun.
Where another fielder would dodge and turn his back,
Duff would just stick his hands up and catch it. He
himself said often that he didn’t know how he did it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think the fellow who had the highest
development of playing ball by instinct,” said Pop
Anderson, who was staying around with the boys,
“was Walter Brodie. He seemed to know from the
sound made by the bat, when the ball was hit, exactly
where it was going. Many a time I have seen him
start to run for a hard-hit fly ball without even
looking, run fifty or seventy-five feet even, and then
turn around for the first time in exactly the right
spot to make the catch. He often used to give
exhibitions before the games of turning his back to
the ball almost as soon as it was hit, taking a run
outward and making the catch with his hands behind
his back and his back to the ball. It may have been
practice, but how he knew where the ball would fall
will always be a great mystery to all who saw him
do it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, Ty,” said Captain Larke, “of a
fielder whose record you can look up and when you get
to be as good as he was, you will be pretty near the
top. I mean Tom McCarthy. It was he who introduced
the trapped ball on outfield flies. If you can
learn to trap a ball as well as he did you will have
learned something which almost every outfielder has
tried but failed to do.</p>

<p>“To ‘trap’ a fly ball is to make a pick up out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
it, as you know. In one Lowell game years ago with
Biltmore, Tom worked his ‘trap’ for two double
plays. Once there were men on first and second.
The batter sent a short fly to Tom. Of course the
runners held to the bases. Instead of making the
catch which would have been easy, Tom scooped it
off the ground. The man on first was, of course,
forced and the man on second was caught on his way
to third. Later in the same game on the same kind
of a fly ball, Tom made believe he was going to trap
the ball again, so the man on second took a big lead.
Tom, however, made a fly catch out of it and
throwing to second made a double play once more.”</p>

<p>“You’ll never be able to catch a Jefferson player
again like you did last year,” said Frank Church
to Everson.</p>

<p>“How’s that,” said Talkington.</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t mention the name of the boy he
caught, because he is present and he doesn’t like the
story, but this same brilliant player was on first in
one of the games and had started to steal second.
The batter made a beautiful line hit to center on a line
about fifteen feet high. Everson, there, stood at second,
looked up and pretended to be getting ready to
catch a nice little pop fly. Seeing this, our good Mr.
Player having failed to keep his eye on the ball
hustled back to first, but by the time he had got back
and taken a second look he saw the center fielder picking
up the ball. Before he could get to second, the
ball had been thrown to Johnny, here, who touched
the bag for a force out. Johnny only laughed but our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
good player said to him then, ‘Grin, you little
shrimp, grin. You had me good, but I’ll get you
some day for it.’”</p>

<p>Everybody had a good laugh at this, even Martin,
for by this time they knew who it was by his sheepish
expression, but they didn’t see how he could get even
with Everson.</p>

<p>So they played many of the games over again and
got very well acquainted with each other and the
rivalry between the two schools was laid aside for the
time being. They left for New York on Wednesday
afternoon on the same train and acted like good
friends together until the next afternoon in New
York when they entered the Polo Grounds with its
row after row of seats entirely surrounding the big
park, when the big crowd that had come to see the
final game stirred up all the bitter rivalry and they
prepared for the big battle.</p>

<p>When they awoke in New York in the morning,
the players, many of whom had never been there,
were somewhat surprised to find that the town was
apparently not excited about what was going to happen.
People seemed to be going about their business
just the same as though the baseball championship was
not to be decided there that day. They didn’t realize,
of course, what a big city New York is nor the habits
of its people.</p>

<p>By noon, however, the crowds on the trolley cars
and elevated traveling northward were enormous,
and it soon developed that the town was headed for
the Polo Grounds. New York had simply hustled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
in the morning to get its business out of the way, so
it could do as it pleased in the afternoon and it
pleased New York to try to see the game.</p>

<p>When the teams got up to One hundred and Fifty-fifth
Street they were as much surprised as they had
been in the morning. The whole town seemed to be
there. Enough to make a good-sized city inside and
about twice as many outside trying to get in.</p>

<p>The gates were locked at noon, three hours
before the game. There was room for no more.
The players got through the crowd as best as they
could. With the help of the policemen, they managed
to clear sufficient space in front of the stands to
engage in a little practice and to warm up the pitchers.
But there was little real practice done that day
outside of enough to limber up their muscles.</p>

<p>Their biggest effort was to keep their nerve in
front of that immense crowd. The familiar scenes
of the other games were presented, but now green
mixed with maroon throughout the stands. One
section of seats all green, the next maroon, etc. The
same noise clubs led the cheers and songs. Most of
the people in the stands knew the songs and cheers
of the rival schools. They gave them with a wealth
of music. A yell and then a chorus. The singing
coaches started “Fair Lowell.” The stands took it
up. The wave of sound mounted and mounted as
the crowd joined in and rose on its feet until all the
stands presented the thrilling spectacle of a singing
multitude, with a kaleidoscopic background of color
that changed from green and white to maroon and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
white and back again, a grand glorious tumult of
voices. They sang the “Alma Mater,” too.</p>

<p>The umpires emerged from under the stands and
walked out onto the field. There was no consultation
with managers. The batting orders had been handed
in early. The gong sounded. It was time for the
game to begin. Then came a sudden stop. Which
team was to go to bat first? Of course it was neutral
ground and that question must be decided. Hughie
and Church tossed the coin. They looked at it as
it landed on the turf. Was it heads or tails? They
both walked back to their benches. The umpire made
his usual announcement of the batteries.</p>

<p>The crowd did not yet know which team had won
the advantage of first in the field. The umpire said,
“Batter up.” Then from the Lowell bench you
could see the team arise quickly and trot out on the
field. The Lowell “rooters” started a mighty cheer.
The advantage of first field was theirs. It was only
a slight advantage but their team thought it an
advantage and that made it one.</p>

<p>A sudden hush falls over the vast multitude. You
can almost hear a pin drop. Laird at the plate, and
Black in the box. Again that first ball may be the
all important one. On it may hang victory, or defeat
for either side. The crowd sits back silent, waiting.
They are ready. So are the players. Alert, waiting.
Suddenly the ball shoots toward the plate like a white
streak. The big final battle is on.</p>

<p>Laird waited and Black pitched two balls which
didn’t fool him any, and then Miner put two over
which cut the corners of the plate, one of which
Laird struck at and missed and the other was called
by the umpire. It was two and two. Then Miner
tried to tempt Harry with a wide one and the umpire
called it a ball, making it two and three, and Black
was forced to put it over. He served up one of the
kind that is hard to put outside of the diamond
and Laird hit it for a bounder straight to the pitchers’
box and Miner set himself for an easy assist, when
just as the ball was all but in his hands, it took an
extra bounce and went high up over his head and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
neither Miner nor Everson could get near it in time
to catch Laird at first.</p>

<p>Beach let two go by and then hit one on the ground
to Everson, who tried for a force out at second; but
Laird beat this throw and both runners were safe.</p>

<p>Captain Church immediately sacrificed Laird and
Beach to third and second respectively. On his way
to the bench, the Jefferson captain put his right hand
on Hollins’ left shoulder as he passed him and
Hollins walked to the plate and gave Laird the signal
for the “squeeze” play, Laird started for home as
soon as the pitcher began to wind up and Hollins hit
the ball smartly for a grounder between third and
short which Delvin went after and fumbled. There
was no chance to get the runner at the plate of course.
The squeeze had been worked beautifully, and with
the Lowell infield watching for it. Arthur’s fumble
was just bad enough in addition to give Hollins time
to get to first and this and the first score put Black
in the hole to such an extent that when La Joy came
up he wanted to give him a base on balls, but only
decided to do so after Hughie gave him the signal
from the bench.</p>

<p>This bit of strategy, however, and the hope of
thereby retiring the side on a double play didn’t work
for Sam Warcford was the next batter. Everybody
was expecting him to try for a long one but he
turned his best chance into what was better still,
a Texas Leaguer in left which scored Beach.</p>

<p>It began to look like the kind of a game the fans
like right there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>The infield came in and Twitchell, the batter, tried
to drive one out of Hans’ reach to his right, but
Hans made a beautiful stop and threw to Gibbie,
forcing Hollins.</p>

<p>The Lowell boys breathed a little easier as there
were now two out although the bases were filled.</p>

<p>Roger Brest came to bat and Black had in mind
the way Roger had worried him in the other games
and decided to get him. Brest let the first one go
by and it was a strike. The second ball he struck
at with a mighty swing and missed. Roger seemed
to be slow in recovering from his swing and Miner
tried to sneak a straight one over on him. But Brest
was only pretending for he hit that ball for about
as swift a liner as ever was hit, about six feet to
Hal’s right. It looked like a sure hit and the
Jefferson Singing Club was already cheering Roger
when Hal stuck out his right hand and the ball stuck
in his glove. Then it was time for Lowell to cheer,
for the spectacular catch had saved two runs at least,
and four runs in the first half is almost too much of
a handicap. It had been a hard inning for Lowell
to get by.</p>

<p>Everson started the ball rolling by hitting the first
ball for a single to right, just to show the other
fellows that there were others who had batting eyes.
Captain Larke’s attempt at a safe one through the
pitcher’s box went a little too near where La Joy
was playing and Everson was forced at second.</p>

<p>Talkington tried hard to put one over Twitchell’s
head, but all he got out of it was the satisfaction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
seeing that sterling right fielder make another of his
sensational catches.</p>

<p>Robb hit one in Hollins’ direction which was too
hot for the Jefferson shortstop to handle, though it
was almost straight into his hands and it went as an
error against him and Robb was safe.</p>

<p>It looked as though Mellen intended to walk Hans,
who was next up, for the first three balls were wide
of the plate. The fourth, however, whether intentional
or not, cut the outer corner and Hans quickly
turned it into a long single to left center, which scored
Larke. <a href="#image41">Robb</a> thought this was a good time to tie
the score and <a href="#image41">tried to come all the way home</a> on
the play. At that he came pretty near making it, for
he made a beautiful slide and was nipped by inches
on the relay from Beach to Hollins to Brest. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
crowd settled back to enjoy what promised to be one
of their favorite games—lots of hitting and sharp
fielding.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 489px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_255">“Robb tried to steal home.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>The second inning opened with Mellen at bat, and
Black went after him. He got two strikes on him
right away, but Mellen made a weak effort on the
next ball and it rolled to the pitcher’s box and was
an easy out for Miner and Hal.</p>

<p>Black then thought he’d make it one of his good
innings. He completely outguessed Laird who
struck out, and when Beach looked as though he
didn’t believe he could do it again, he put one straight
over on Tommy after the latter had fouled one off
and let another be called on him, and Beach struck
out also, retiring the side.</p>

<p>In the second half Hal was first at bat. Hughie
told him he just had to get on base and to hit it out.
Mellen put one over that looked good and Hal struck
at it with his short bat and missed. The next one
looked even better and Hal hit it for one of those
fast curving singles over Laird’s head which landed
him on first.</p>

<p>Delvin fouled out to Laird and Hal made a clean
steal of second on the first ball pitched to Gibbie.
He then made an effort to steal third and in Roger’s
anxiety to catch him he tried to throw before he had
the ball secure in his hand and it bounded off his
glove for a short passed ball, while Hal reached third
easily.</p>

<p>Gibbie came across with the needed long fly to
Warcford in left and Hal brought in the tying run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Black, next to bat, made a hard try to hit one of
the three balls that Mellen pitched him, but he
missed all three of them and as he picked up his
glove and walked into the box, Hughie said, “That’s
the way, old boy, save your wind and strength for
pitching.”</p>

<p>Captain Manager Church was first at bat and he
hit one on Arthur’s left, which both Delvin and
Hagner went after. It was too fast for Arthur to
get his hands on, but Hans made a quick lunge and
got it fifteen feet back of Delvin and threw quickly
to first where Hal made a neat pick up and retired
Church. Hollins tried to bunt the first ball pitched
and missed. Then he struck hard at the second one
and missed, and with his mind on nothing but fooling
the Lowell infield by his change of tactics he forgot
all about the rules when he saw the Lowell boys
playing back and bunted the next ball which rolled
foul and he was called out.</p>

<p>La Joy made one of his mighty efforts after getting
two strikes, and it went out to left field where <a href="#image42">Captain
Larke caught it after a long run</a> close to the foul
line.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 510px;">
<a name="image42" id="image42">
  <img src="images/image42.jpg" width="510" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_257">“Capt. Larke caught it after a long run.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>It began to look as if each full inning would be
practically the same, for the Lowell half of the third
was also short. Everson batted one to La Joy which
was easy for him, and Church, then Larke and
Talkington were both retired by Hollins and Church.</p>

<p>In the Jefferson half of the fourth the fun began
anew.</p>

<p>Warcford fouled off the first two over the stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and when Black offered him another one he didn’t do
any waiting either, but rapped it far out over to
right center in Robb’s territory. Ty picked it up
after a stern chase and relayed it to Hal, for Sam was
already well on his way to third and Ty played to
catch him at the plate in case he tried to get home.</p>

<p>Things looked a little better, however, when
Twitchell went out on a pop foul to Gibbie. Black
thinking of the near damage which Brest had done
in the first inning walked him, planning to get Mellen
and a possible double play, but Big George knocked
out a beautiful sacrifice fly to Talkington which
scored Warcford. Tris saw that he couldn’t get the
runner on third and quickly threw to Everson on
second, catching Brest between the bases. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
finally run down by Johnny and Hal, the latter
getting the put out.</p>

<p>This made the score three to two in Jefferson’s
favor and it was up to Lowell to do a little better.</p>

<p>Robb missed one and fouled off another. The
third one was also a foul, a tip, and Roger held on
to it making a strike out for Ty. Then Hans walked
to the plate and crouching in his accustomed manner
watched two go by—one a strike and the other a
ball. The third one he hit on a beautiful line over
Hollins’ head between Beach and Warcford. Beach
fielded it and threw to third as Hans had already
passed second. He, however, went back when he
saw that the throw would beat him.</p>

<p>Hal came up and giving the signal to Hans hit a
fast grounder to the left of the pitcher’s box which
went toward second like a shot and was well fielded
by Hollins. Hans was, however, almost home by
this time and all Hollins could do was to catch Hal
at first which he did. The score was again tied and
two out, Delvin made the third one by knocking a
fly into Warcford’s hands.</p>

<p>It had been nip and tuck between the two teams
up to this time with the advantage of a lead, when
there was any, always with Jefferson, and Lowell’s
best efforts were used to keep even.</p>

<p>The strain was beginning to tell on both teams,
and Black buckled down to outguess Laird, the first
man up in the fifth, but Laird was the best guesser
and got a base on balls when Miner failed to put the
third one over. Tommy Beach made a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
bunt down the third base line and as Laird had a
good lead off first he got all the way around to third
when the throw went to first and Beach was out.</p>

<p>Church at bat signaled Laird for another squeeze
play and Harry did his part all right, but Jefferson’s
captain missed the ball and Gibbie touched Laird
out at the plate. Then Church hit a fast bounder
to the left of Arthur who made a great stop and
throw to Hal, retiring Church.</p>

<p>Gibbie came to bat and singled to right and
there was great hope of Lowell getting the advantage.
The plan went through all right so far as
Miner was concerned, as he sacrificed and Gibbie
reached second.</p>

<p>This brought Johnny to bat and he had the hard
luck to touch one of Mellen’s twisters for a foul
which fell into Roger’s big mitt and there were
two out.</p>

<p>Captain Larke tried to knock the ball out of the
diamond but the best he could do was an easy roller
to La Joy who, however, made a mess of it with two
attempts at picking it up before getting it, and by
that time Larke was safe on first and Gibbie on
third.</p>

<p>Larke started for second to draw the throw for
the double steal but Roger couldn’t be tempted to
throw the ball any place and Cap got credit for a
steal. Having struck out Robb before, Mellen
walked Talkington, filling the bases, and then Ty
knocked a fly to the fence in center field; but when
it came down Beach was there waiting for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>Hollins, the first batter for Jefferson in the sixth,
ought to have been out, as he knocked a liner direct
into Robb’s hands. Ty dropped it, however, and
Hollins hustled to first. The error upset the boys
a little and when Hollins started to steal second
Gibbie made a poor throw and the Jefferson shortstop
was safe.</p>

<p>La Joy waited and got his base on balls which
was good judgment on Black’s part as it later
developed. Warcford came to bat and struck
viciously at the first ball and missed and the infield
guessed that Sam was bound to hit it out. All but
Hal did, at any rate, for when Miner pitched the
next ball and Sam bunted Hal started on his bunt
fielding run to the plate, and making a quick stop
he threw to Delvin at third, forcing Hollins. Then,
with Warcford on first, Twitchell hit a fast one to
Case, who made a one-hand stop, threw to Hans
who covered second, and then hustled back to first
in time to receive Hans’ return throw completing
a quick double play and retiring the side.</p>

<p>Hans came up in the Lowell half and got another
double. Hal sacrificed him to third and it again
looked as though Lowell might take the lead. Delvin
made what ought to have been a hit, for he drove a
fast liner toward first, but Church stabbed it after a
mighty leap into the air, and there were two out.
Then the Lowell hope died down once more when
Gibbie hit one to Mellen, who threw him out to
Church.</p>

<p>Brest struck at three fast ones and missed all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
them. Mellen went out also on a grounder that was
easy for Hans and Hal. Laird came along with a
pretty single to left, but was immediately caught
stealing, Gibbie to Hans.</p>

<p>In the Lowell half Black hit one between first and
second, which Church fielded nicely and threw to
Mellen who covered the bag.</p>

<p>Everson hit a bounder to Hollins who let it roll
between his legs, and Johnny was safe. Larke hit
one, which La Joy got with little effort and tossed to
Hollins, forcing Everson. Larke immediately stole
second, Roger’s throw being high. Talkington caught
them all napping by bunting toward third and
reached first safely. Then it was Robb’s turn and he
tried hard swinging on the first ball pitched which
was one of Mellen’s twisters again, and it went foul
back of third and was caught by Hollins after a
great run.</p>

<p>The eighth started well and ended badly for
Lowell.</p>

<p>Tommy tried for his usual two bagger, but
Talkington got in the way of his fast liner after a
mighty run and there was one gone.</p>

<p>Church tried to put one in short right but it went
up in the air and foul. Case got it after a backward
run near the first row of the grand stand.</p>

<p>Hollins dropped a short bunt in front of the plate
and Gibbie fumbled it. Hollins was easily safe.
It did not look bad to Black, however, as there were
two out and the boys were fielding nobly, and Miner
intended to make the next batter knock a fly if he hit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
it at all. It happened, however, to be La Joy. Larry
fouled off four and it was certain in Black’s mind that
if the kind of balls he was pitching were hit they
would go up in the air, so he put over another one.
Larry acted badly, however, for he straightened out
that curve for a two bagger between Robb and
Talkington, which scored Hollins. This rather got
Black’s nerves temporarily and he didn’t have perfect
control of himself. When Warcford stepped to the
plate, Gibbie signaled for a low ball. Black insisted
upon sending them up on the inside. Here is where
Black went wrong, for Warcford hit the first one for
a single to left and La Joy scored from second. Two
runs in and both of them after two were out and it
looked like the game. To complete the inning,
Warcford tried to steal, but Gibbie nailed him by
four feet on a perfect throw to Everson and the
inning ended with the score 5 to 3 in favor of
Jefferson.</p>

<p>It looked bad for Lowell, as they had been behind
at all stages of the contest and the score as it stood
then, taking into consideration the high-class fielding
of both teams, made it look as though Lowell was
surely beaten.</p>

<p>“Now is the time to do it,” said Hughie as Hans
walked to the bat. “This is the one grand chance
to get them. We only need three, Hans, and you
can get one.”</p>

<p>Hughie’s coaching made no difference to Hans
either way. He kept his eye on Mellen and the
ball and when Mellen finally sent one up Hans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
smashed it for a single to right which got him to
first.</p>

<p>Hal tried to hit it out and got a long fly to
Warcford which kept Hans on first.</p>

<p>Delvin came up determined to do or die and he
dropped a beautiful single in left which Warcford
fielded quickly, holding Hans on second. Then
Gibbie tried to knock the cover off the ball. He
struck three times at what appeared like good ones
and missed three of them, which was very good work
on Mellen’s part. Hughie now sent Huyler up to
bat for Black. Being two out Hans and Delvin
started and got away with a double steal, Hans going
to third and Arthur to second.</p>

<p>It was the only chance Huyler had in the game.
He landed on the second ball pitched for a beautiful
liner which went to the right field fence, but the
unbeatable Twitchell made it look like an easy out,
for he timed the ball to the instant and made a
running catch that was as clever as any that had been
made in the entire game. This made three out and
Jefferson still two runs ahead.</p>

<p>The Jefferson crowd felt they had the game salted
away and the team needed only to hold its advantage
and the Championship was theirs. At the same time
they intended to make the most of their last time
at bat.</p>

<p>Babe Radams went in to pitch for Lowell and
Twitchell feeling good over his line catch of a
moment before couldn’t be stopped. He leaned
against the third ball the Babe tossed up for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
well-played single to right. This hit and Brest’s
monkey shines at the plate got Babe going for a
minute and Roger walked. Mellen, good hitter
always, wanted to drive it out, but Captain Church
ordered the sacrifice, and Twitchell reached third, and
Roger got to second.</p>

<p>Laird came up to turn the trick and knocked one
that took just one bound in Hans’ direction, and then
tried to get over Hagner’s head, but Hans went up
in the air, lurching somewhat to the right, got it,
and with the same motion fired the ball to Gibbie,
who got Twitchell at the plate. To the crowd it
looked safe, but the umpire said “out” and that
settled it.</p>

<p>Babe’s nerves were on edge by this time and
unfortunately he hit Beach with a pitched ball and
the bases were full. This put everybody more or less
up in the air and anything might happen.</p>

<p>Church now came to bat. He was trying to make
Babe walk him, and he did get three balls. Then Babe
put two over which the Captain-manager missed.
The last one he hit right over third base and nine
times out of ten it would have been a safe hit but
Arthur managed to knock it down with his right
hand, and then picking it up hurriedly he fired it in
Hal’s direction, but high. If there ever was a ball
that was headed for the grand stand it was that one.
For height it came near the record. The Jefferson
crowd went wild, but they had never really seen Hal
climb into the air. He ran three steps, made a
mighty leap into the air, his back to the ball, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
then that right hand of his shot up one, two, maybe
four feet higher, and he got it. He was as far from
the bag almost as the runner, only he was up over it.
He came to earth feet on the base and as the umpire
waved his hand for the out, Hal and Church came
together and the breath was knocked out of both of
them.</p>

<p>He had to call time, for these boys were both
unconscious for a few minutes.</p>

<p>When Hal opened his eyes his first words were,
“Did I get it,” but he couldn’t hear the answer, as
the stands were yelling, “Oh, you Hal! Oh, you
Case!” and then he heard Arthur say, “You saved
the game for us, Hal. We’ve got another chance,”
and when he turned to Hughie the latter just shook
his hand. He was too much overcome to speak.</p>

<p>Then Lowell went to bat for the final half of the
ninth with renewed courage, for the God of Champions
surely intended them to have another chance
when he enabled Hal to make that stop.</p>

<p>It had been a stern chase all the way for Lowell
and now it was up to them for the last time. It would
take three runs to win, but they had often made three
or more runs in the last half and Hal’s catch had put
the fire back into their hearts.</p>

<p>That’s the way they felt when Everson, the head
of the batting list, came up. If he could get a base
on balls he would have a good start thought he, at
least he decided to wait until the count was two and
two. That’s the way it worked out—two balls and
then two strikes, one of which Johnny tried for. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
guessed that Mellen would try to put the next one
over and Johnny decided to hit it out. Mellen on
the other hand wanted him to guess that way and he
sent up what looked like a fast straight one. Johnny
gave his sharp quick swing and missed. He had
struck out.</p>

<p>It was a bad start. Larke came up and without
waiting banged the first ball past the pitcher and out
toward second base. The ball hit the bag, and
glancing off at an angle to the right rolled straight
into La Joy’s hands and it was two out and hope
almost dead.</p>

<p>“They have to put three out before we’re beat,
boys,” called Hughie after Talkington as the latter
picked up his bat and started for the plate and all the
Lowell rooters prayed hard even while hope died
within them.</p>

<p>Mellen in the box, cool, confident, and with the
big strain nearly over, was tempted to fool with
Talkington. He had hopes of striking him out. He
started two balls straight for the plate but they curved
out. Tris let them go by and the umpire said after
the second one, “Ball two.” Then he started one
wide of the plate but failed to get the curve on it
and it went for third ball. The next two came
straight over but Tris never moved and let the umpire
call “Strike two.” The crowd stood up ready to
go home as Mellen let go the last ball. It was a
wild pitch that hit the ground in front of the plate
and Talkington trotted to first. The crowd sat down
again. There might be something doing after all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Mellen was surprised and a little nervous. He let
the first one slip a little and it came within reach
of Ty’s bat, who connected with it for a single to
right on which Talkington got to third. Then Ty
stole second, which wasn’t hard, as Roger didn’t dare
throw.</p>

<p>The slight chance had developed into an opportunity
for the next batter, who was Hans.</p>

<p>Hughie was on the third base line yelling, “Eyah!
Eyah! We’ve got them, boys!” pulling grass with
both hands, yelling, whistling, kicking the air and
calling, “You can do it” to Hans.</p>

<p>Church walked over to the pitcher’s box and La
Joy and Brest joined them where they held a
consultation at which it was decided to walk Hans.
This was a natural thing to do, as Hal who was
up next, while a good batter, was not so sure to get
it safe. Hans knew what they were up to and the
Jefferson boys knew he knew it. So he stood there
at the plate, more or less resigned to his fate, acting
as though it wasn’t any use even to watch the balls
as they were pitched. At the same time he was
standing a little nearer the plate than he usually did
although Mellen didn’t notice this. Hans let three
go by and they were about as wide of the plate as
three balls could be. Hans hadn’t moved. When
Mellen started to pitch the fourth ball Hans’ bat
was swinging in his left hand. The ball came on
high and wide and apparently Hans was going to
take his base but as the ball approached <a href="#image43">he took
one step forward, swung his bat up and out and met </a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
<a href="#image43">the ball on the nose</a>. When Mellen heard the crack
of the bat his arms dropped to his sides and he didn’t
even turn to look where the ball went. He knew
that ball wasn’t meant to be caught by any fielder
within the grounds. As it went over Twitchell’s
head that fellow also knew it would do no good for
him to give chase and as for the rest of the Jefferson
team, all of them except Church and La Joy stood
still with mouths open and watched the ball go sailing
clean over the right-field bleachers into the runway
which leads from the ticket offices into the grand
stand, and if they could have followed it after that
they would have seen it bounce beyond the turnstile
and clear out onto the elevated tracks, where it
dropped through to the street. The aforesaid Church
and La Joy merely took off their caps, threw them
into the dust and stamped on them. Then they picked
them up, brushed them off and put them back on
their heads.</p>

<div class="caption">
  <a href="#Page_268">“He took one step forward, swung his bat up and out and met the ball on the nose.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile Talkington, Robb and Hagner had
touched the plate and were trying to get through
the crowd of Lowell rooters who had surrounded
them and the other members of the team.</p>

<p>It was nothing but shoulders for the boys after
that. Up they went surrounded by thousands for a
parade around the park.</p>

<p>“Where’s Hal? He saved it!” shouted the
crowd, and then, “Where’s Hans? He won it,” and
after they had borne these two to the head of the
procession, though no one could tell how it was
possible, they carried them round the field a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
times to the music of Lowell songs and yells, to
finally land them at the Club House door where
they left them to bathe and dress, after giving them
to understand they were expected to attend the Lowell
banquet at the Waldorf at eight.</p>

<p>Words could not describe the reception given to
Hans and Hal by their team mates in the club house
of the New York Nationals that afternoon, so no
attempt will be made to do so, suffice it to say that
it was thoroughly impressed on both that but for
them the championship had been lost, and their
names went to the top of the list of the Lowell Hall
of Heroes.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>HAL-HONUSED</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Tim Murnin witnessed the great deciding game
from the press box, at the Polo Grounds, where he
found a lot of other budding newspaper men who had
been sent to New York to report the game for various
journals. At a big ball game you find all kinds of
people, and every class of newspaper or periodical
reports the big games for its readers. Naturally
these reporters try to make their reports interesting
to their particular kind of readers and that is why,
for instance, Swat Milligan in reporting the game to
the <cite>Railway Signal</cite> described it in language that
was perfectly intelligible to its readers, although it
might be puzzling to the patrons of the <cite>Farm
Weekly</cite>.</p>

<p>After Tim got started on his report he got to
looking over the shoulders of the other reporters
and had a great idea.</p>

<p>This is it. He would crib an inning or a part of
an inning from each of the writers near him just
to get their style, and he did it. When he got the
jumbled mass together and arranged it according to
the innings he wrote an introduction and wired the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
report to Lowell, where it appeared in the <cite>Reporter</cite>
the next day. Here it is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Lowell, 6—Jefferson, 5.</span></p>

<p>“Hal and Honus, the incomparable and inseparable
beauties of the Lowell posy garden, render the
Jefferson assault hopeless and Tim Murnin’s pets are
returned as champions.</p>

<p>“Childe Harold, the peerless bunt killer from the
Pacific, stopped them all. He dug them out of the
trenches, climbed into the ozone for the high ones,
and stabbed the wide ones for as natty a row of
put outs as ever graced the fourth column of the box
score.</p>

<p>“Honus bumped the opposing slab artists for an
accumulation of ordinaries, repeaters, and a varied
assortment of stick talk, including a sizzling homer
that made dents in the car tracks on Eighth Avenue,
and brought in a quarter dozen of much needed
tallies, just enough to save the day.”</p></div>

<p>When the game opened Tim looked over the
shoulder of Swat Milligan, of the <cite>Railway Signal</cite>,
sitting on his right, and this is what he read as a
report of the first half.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The Laird of the West bumped one out of the
home station which Miner tried to flag as it switched
to the overhead track, and got a through ticket to
Caseville.</p>

<p>“Beach rolled one out of the depot which ran local
all the way to Everson, but by the time Johnny shut
off the power Laird had caught an express which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
landed him safely at the middle junction and Beach
was returning to the first stop for more coal.</p>

<p>“Captain Church went out on the Sacrifice Limited
and Laird and Beach rolled into the next stops on
time.</p>

<p>“Hollins now received orders from the Chief
Dispatcher to squeeze the Laird Limited through and
relieve the congestion. He made an opening and the
Laird came through with wide open throttle while
Hollins went to Caseville.</p>

<p>“Larry wanted a special for a joy ride but there
was nothing nearer than the first station, and the
General Superintendent suggested that he walk there.</p>

<p>“Warcford coaled one up for a long run to Larketown,
but the steam gave out back of Port Arthur
on the Texas League Division and Sam went to
Caseville too as Beach pulled into the depot and went
to the tank for water.</p>

<p>“Twitchell engineered one out to Hagnerville,
but Hans got his hand on the throttle and putting
on the reverse backed it into the home station where
it ran into and wrecked the Hollins Local.</p>

<p>“Brest then pushed out a Cannon Ball Express
on the upper level, but Hal was walking the track and
it came to a dead stop when he set the block
against it.”</p></div>

<p>For the second half of the first inning and first
of the second, Tim poached on the efforts of Francis
Huff, of <cite>The Flower and Fruit Weekly</cite> and what he
saw looked good enough to put in his own copy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“Johnny Everson dispatched an unmarried one
to right just to show he had an eye for beauty. The
captain pushed a clover kisser to Larry and reached
first as Johnny faded at second. Talkington arched
a rainbow to the outer gardens, but Twitchell was
there and plucked the bags of gold from the other
end.</p>

<p>“Robb then shot a bunch of pepper at Hollins
which the latter made a mess of, and Ty got to first.</p>

<p>“Hans was invited to walk down to The Church
but he preferred to stay where the posies wave in
the breeze until he poked a blossom nipper out to
Warcford’s daisy patch and Larke came home with
the first bouquet for Lowell.</p>

<p>“<a href="#image44">Ty was anxious to bring his bouquet home</a>, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
and show it to Hughie, but his flowers were already
in full bloom and wilted in the dust at the plate when
Roger touched them.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 473px;">
<a name="image44" id="image44">
  <img src="images/image44.jpg" width="473" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_274">“Ty was anxious to bring his bouquet home.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Lowell now went into the garden and Mellen
planted himself at the rubber. He looked ripe to
Black who tried to pluck him. He nearly did it, too,
and Mellen, weakened, dropped from the vine, and
rolled to Miner who tossed him out of the garden
to Hal. Black then alone got the Laird’s goat and
sent him to the shed and with three swings cut down
the young Beach that grew where the Laird had
stood.”</p></div>

<p>Then there was a fellow sitting in front of him
whom nobody knew, who was writing busily. He
must have been connected with some burglar sheet,
for he was using the kind of talk that made Tim
look to see if his pocketbook was still there, after
he had dug up this sample, which was no doubt
intended for, say, the <cite>Second-Story Weekly</cite> or something
like that.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“In the second half of the deuce stanza Childe
Harold got the combination of the safe and stole
a maiden who danced on his left. Arthur came out
of the coop to show what he had but his best was
chicken which roosted finally in Roger’s mitt.</p>

<p>“When Gibbie came up Hal turned robber and
purloined the middle cushion and then the third also,
in broad daylight, while Roger made two efforts to
grab his gun. Gibbie lifted a high one that looked
good to go over Warcford’s second story but Sam
turned porch climber and arrested it. Black thrice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
got the scent but immediately lost it and was sent
to the box to look for the other clews.”</p></div>

<p>Abe Zeager, of <cite>Pulpit Platform and Song</cite>, sat
right next to this second-story fellow so it averaged
things up, thought Tim, as he copied what was said
about the next full inning.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Church Captain opened the next meeting
with a few hot remarks which he addressed particularly
to Delvin and Hagner. They were too deep for
Arthur’s study box but struck Hans about right and
he put Hal next as the Jefferson captain meandered
down the first aisle and the captain felt put out.</p>

<p>“Hollins was called out in open meeting for
violating the rules of the committee on buntings,
having offended the third time.</p>

<p>“La Joy started a song with a false high note.
The Larke caught it up and the Professor dismissed
the class on the strength of it, there being no score,
and it was the time for Lowell’s Choir practice.</p>

<p>“But it was of short duration, as Everson’s first
note was off the key and on Larry’s kick Johnny was
put out of the class and Larke and Talkington went
out to Church after trying to get beyond Hollinsville.”</p></div>

<p>Then on the other side of this fellow, strange to
say, sat Frank Dichter, of the <cite>Police News</cite>, who no
doubt was putting it all in language that the boys
down at headquarters could understand and Tim
didn’t have to look any farther for a characteristic
account of what happened to Jefferson in their next
time at bat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Warcford scared the top row of the left-side
bleachers twice and two small boys got passes to
the inside.</p>

<p>“The third one stayed inside and in front and
Sammy pulled up at third when he saw <a href="#image45">Church
waving the red lantern</a> as Ty relayed the ball to Hal,
who ferried it to Gibbie. Twitchell handed a horseshoe
to Gibbie, Roger the cop was let go to his beat
without swinging his stick. Big George pried the
lid off when he handed a long one to Tris and
Warcford got away with the goods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 401px;">
<a name="image45" id="image45">
  <img src="images/image45.jpg" width="401" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_277">“Church waving a red lantern.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Roger was caught off his beat and chased to the
station by Johnny and Hal.”</p></div>

<p>Farther over in the box Tim heard some ticker
talk about the market, etc., and he went over to see
if he could decipher the stuff that was being sent out
by Sid Mercury, of the <cite>Salesman’s Review</cite>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Ty hurried out to see what was being offered in
the market, but after missing the best there was, he
sent an inquiry up among the dollar sitters and when
he again thought he saw a good thing he found it
was only a tip which Roger had acted on.</p>

<p>“The mighty Hagner Honused forward and after
inspecting the Mellen spring samples gave an order
for three bags, paying for two for immediate delivery.
Beach the credit man canceled the order for
the extra bag claiming Honus’ credit wasn’t good
for the third but he wasn’t anxious to extend himself
anyhow.</p>

<p>“Hal came up but he wasn’t ready to buy although
he did make a pretty fair offer to Hollins for the
best he had in the shop, which the latter turned down
through his manager.</p>

<p>“Honus had, however, done so well in negotiating
his two bags by this time that he hurried home to
look for more bargains.</p>

<p>“When Mellen drove the next one down the lane
Arthur hitched a fly kid on to his wagon and he
gave it a long ride to Warcford.”</p></div>

<p>There was a fellow sitting some distance away who
had on a sailor suit and Tim asked him who he was.
“I’m Sam Lane, of <cite>Man of War’s Man</cite>, and I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
telling the boys about the game in the style they
like.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“In the first half of the fifth Miner sent one up
through the outside passage after it was two and
three and the Harbor Master gave The Laird clearance
papers for the next port of call. The Laird
then turned pirate and started to run wild on the
high seas with the patrol ship Gibbie in hot pursuit
when the Pirate Brig Beach made a sortie under short
bunting and the fight was centered on the Beach while
The Laird entered a cove at Delvin’s Island.</p>

<p>“Captain Church, of the Pirate League, then set
all sails and primed the guns to squeeze the enemy,
while The Laird made a dash for the home shelter,
but he miss-fired and The Laird went to the Gibbie
as a prize.</p>

<p>“Captain Church then made an effort to rescue
himself by jumping with a lifesaver, but the latter
floated toward Delvin’s Island while the tide carried
the captain toward Caseville, and Hal got him out
with a jerk.</p>

<p>“Gibbie came alongside and launched a screamer
to the side one should always pass on. Miner laid
himself on the altar and Gibbie jumped to the second
landing.”</p></div>

<p>Just as Tim was going back to his seat he heard
Norman Rhodes, of the <cite>Churchman</cite>, clicking it off
like this.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The Human Crab then offered his mite, but it
was tainted money that dropped into Roger’s contribution
box.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>And farther along he caught the reporter for
<cite>Janitors’ Hints</cite> sending this.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Captain Larke pushed a vacuum cleaner to La
Joy which picked up dust all the way and reached
first when Larry couldn’t stop the motor and Gibbie
was beating the rug at the near station.”</p></div>

<p>Tim then asked Van Lent, of the <cite>National
Detective</cite>, how he liked the game and the latter
handed him his report of the next half inning saying,
“You can see what I am saying about it.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Larke wirelessed Gibbie the code word for the
double pilfer and although Pinkerton Roger received
the message too he was afraid to leave the home
station without an operator and couldn’t prevent the
captain from committing the crime.</p>

<p>“Mellen pinned four stripes to Talkington’s
batting suit, filling all the cells, and then Robb tried
to arrange a get away for the bunch by a breakaway
over the center fence but the Chief Hawkeye
of the Jefferson outer guard stone-walled it and the
prisoners were all sent to the yard.”</p></div>

<p>S. C. Rice, of the <cite>Bakers’ and Confectioners’
Daily</cite> was kneading his report of the game into shape
so that his folks could see it and he was going along
like this.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Hollins, who was the first to stir the batter in
the sixth, hoisted a wad of dough to Ty whose fingers
were buttered, however, and Eddie was presented
with the first bun.</p>

<p>“It tasted like more and Eddie reached through
the kitchen window and stole the second.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“Larry loafed around the office door and they
gave him a pass to the free lunch counter. Warcford
started one toward China which Hal dug out of
the turf, and snow balled to Arthur, who congealed
to it in time to put Hollins on ice.”</p></div>

<p>Passing back to his regular seat Tim heard the
operator for <cite>English Society</cite> who happened to be
Buckingham Roseberry wiring this to his sheet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Twitchell jolted a bounder to Childe Harold
who diverted it to Hans, eliminating Warcford and
then returned to his doorstep in time to put the ‘not-at-home’
sign out before Martin called, when Hans
handed it to him.”</p></div>

<p>The readers of <cite>Ivory Ball Review</cite> were going to
be entertained the next day by a description of the
contest, which ran something like the following, from
Hugh Fullers their correspondent.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Hans miscued twice and then made a two cushion
shot into the second pocket. Delvin attempted a
follow through on a shot to the right corner, but
was kissed off by Church. Gibbie tried a long draw
past the middle pocket but was froze, Mellen to
Church and all he got was, ‘You ought to have
had it.’”</p></div>

<p>While Ernest Banigan, of the <cite>Daily Provision
Market</cite>, was crowding the telegraph lines with the
following rehash, although Tim thought that in the
last part of the report of the particular play noted
Erny was getting his wires crossed, though he may

<p>“Brest hit the hole in three large doughnuts that
Miner passed to him from the pretzel station,
Mellen’s barker went into the Hagner-Case sausage
factory. Laird hoisted a cuckoo over Delvin’s tower,

Eddie like the pig in the alley did the bow-legged man

chased one to second which Larry stabbed and Johnny

it to the middle gate, but Talkington hugged it for
an early demise, and his wishbone was where his backbone
ought to be.</p>

<p>“Church winged a broiler to the poultry farm
back of first and Case wrung its neck. Hollins
pushed a fresh-laid one over the edge of the plate
which Gibbie scrambled and Eddie reached his nest.</p>

<p>Rothe Child, of <cite>The American Youth</cite>, jumped

Twitchell was overcome at the home station when
Gibbie told him the news.</p>

Tim was doing by this time and he said, “How do

<p>“The captain of the Arson Band sneaked forward
to light the fuse and start the conflagration while
his pals hauled down the champions’ flag and as the
infant burned the third one over the Captain fired a
dynamite bomb over Delvin Square to set fire to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
city, and the robbers got busy. Little Arthur,
however, guarding his station, was prepared to die
a patriot and although he had to handle it with
gloves he knocked it down and quickly turned in
the alarm calling out all reserves.</p>

<p>“He then proceeded calmly to throw the thing
out of the lot, but missed, and it was headed for the
top floor of the Lowell Hall of Heroes which it
would have destroyed had not Hal got out his scaling
ladder and grabbed it as it was going through and the
Arson crew was sent away when Hal came down with
the evidence.”</p></div>

<p>By this, however, Tim thought it was time to put
a little of himself in to the report, and he contributed
the last half of the ninth himself.</p>

<p>“Then it was up to the Dr. Lawrence’s Willing
Workers to beat it to the woods and not come back
empty-handed if they wanted any supper that night,
with little brother Hughie tugging at the apron
strings telling how hungry he was.</p>

<p>“Johnny was the first to shoulder his gun and
walked down the lane boldly with his chin in the
air, promising to come back with one bag full at least.</p>

<p>“He saw game, too, but after pulling the trigger
three times discovered his gun wasn’t loaded and
came back for ammunition, but was sent to bed
without partaking of the feast.</p>

<p>“Larke started out with his double-barrel shotgun
all loaded and primed and saw tracks immediately,
but as luck would have it when he followed
them over behind La Joy’s barn old man Larry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>

the first gate.</p>

<p>“Tris stirred up three crows and a couple of
whistlers as soon as he got to the shooting grounds.
The crows were too far away, however, and the
whistlers were too fast for good shooting, so he
waited. Tris became discouraged when the next was
a crow which landed on the ground in front of him
and the game warden told him they were running
better down by the first turn.</p>

<p>“Ty walked to the firing line with just one bullet
in his rifle with which he winged a bird that dropped
in right field, Ty going to the first trap while Tris
ran to the third, with Laird and Twitchell trying to
put salt on his tail. Ty then grabbed Larry’s bag
and he had two.</p>

<p>“Hans was sent out to bring in the game, and
Mellen, who was operating the trap, was ordered to
serve four of the closed season kind and chase him
to the duck pond.</p>

<p>“The first was a ladybird far out to the right,
the next was a mud hen that hugged the ground, the
third was a waxwing far out of Hans’ reach. The
fourth was a moth ball intended to lay Hans away
for good; but he made one of his muscle-racking
lunges, and hitting that moth ball on the solar plexus,
released a humming bird that darted where the
nightingale warbles its lay and the glowworm
glimmers, while Hans snatched four full bags and
almost beat Tris and Ty to the supper table, and the
suspense was ended.”</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<small>AWARDING THE PRIZES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It would be impossible to describe in words the
reception which the team received upon its return to
Lowell after this memorable game at the Polo
Grounds. Of receptions, there had been plenty to
victorious teams at Lowell, but all those that had
gone before could not compare in any way with the
glorious welcome that was given the team of 19—.</p>

<p>Commencement was still a few days off, but the
season was over and it was time to put away the
ball, bat, and glove, so far as real games were
concerned. Very soon commencement day would
arrive and that day would see the departure from
school of some of the greatest players the college
world has ever known.</p>

<p>The evening before commencement the scholarship
prize winners were announced by the Intercollegiate
Athletic Association. There were hardly any
surprises on this score, for it was apparent even before
the games with Jefferson, to the few who had seen
the two teams play, that Lowell would again carry
off the prizes.</p>

<p>The wonderful showing made by Case, Hagner,
Radams, and Robb during almost the entire season,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
put them so far ahead of all competitors that there
could be but one result.</p>

<p>Hans, of course, standing head and shoulders
above all of them in the records, carried off the prize
as the best all-round man. Hagner was, next to
Hal, the happiest man in school. No more selling
books for him. His college course was assured.
Furthermore, he received an invitation from the
Pirates to join them at the end of his course at a
salary which was so tempting that right then he
signed a contract to begin as soon as he graduated,
or before, if he chose.</p>

<p>Case also need not worry in future about his college<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
expenses. All tuition and five hundred dollars per
year during his college course was a wonderful thing
for him, he thought; but when the manager of the
Highlanders came along and offered him five thousand
dollars a year to play with them after he was
graduated he could hardly contain himself.</p>

<div class="figcenter50" style="width: 438px;">

  <img src="images/image47.jpg" width="438" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_289">Hal and Hans get offers from professional ball clubs.</a></div>
</div>

<p>Radams was the winning pitcher, according to the
records, and after considering a lot of offers he agreed
to play with the Pittsburg Pirates, upon leaving
school, if at all, because Larke and Gibbs had wanted
him to.</p>

<p>Robb drew the other scholarship prize and there
was a great scramble among the professionals to
induce this heavy hitting outfielder to come with
them. Jenkins, however, took Robb aside and told
him quietly that instead of practicing law right away,
he was going to play professional ball for a few
years, that he had received such a tempting offer
from the Tigers to manage their club that he could
make more out of it than out of the law, and that
professional baseball had been put on such a high
plane in the last few years that it was as good a
profession as any. He got Robb to agree to play
ball with the Tigers, if he played on any professional
team in the future.</p>

<p>Talkington fell a victim to the wiles of a Red
Sox scout, so far as his promises were concerned, and
agreed to join them as soon as he was graduated.</p>

<p>Several of the graduating players thought as
Jenkins, and could not resist the tempting offers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
large sums to join the big leagues and play ball
for a living for a while.</p>

<p>Larke and Gibbs, as stated before, joined the
Pittsburg Pirates. Larke as manager, and that’s how
Radams came to show up there later.</p>

<p>Everson said he was going into the shoe business
in New York State, and he did; but he couldn’t resist
the temptation offered him by the Cubs and for many
years played a rattling game at second base for them,
and made a lot of money in this way. When he got
there he was much surprised to find Miner Black
pitching for them.</p>

<p>Delvin was signed by the famous New York
Giants and for years was the premier third baseman
of the country.</p>

<p>And as these alumni boys traveled over the country
entertaining thousands by the display of their ability
in the national sport they ran across most of the
Jefferson team of their college days.</p>

<p>Frank Church became captain-manager of the
Cubs where Everson and Black played and of course
they had to talk over the great college games of
19— again.</p>

<p>Twitchell was showing the fans down in Cincinnati
how to play right field.</p>

<p>La Joy turned up as manager and second baseman
of the Naps of Cleveland.</p>

<p>Sam Warcford and George Mellen found old foes
and made new friends when they met Jenkins and
Robb on the Tigers, and you would have seen the
surprise of your life if you had been present when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Howard Cam and Tommy Beach hunted up the
manager of the Pirates and found it was former
Captain Larke of Lowell.</p>

<p>Roger Brest, it was learned, was trying his hand
at managing the Cardinals of St. Louis, while Hollins
landed with the Athletics of Philadelphia, and Harry
Laird went with the Red Sox of Boston.</p>

<p>And so, boys, you who read this have read the story
of the two greatest baseball teams ever known and
seen how most of them learned their baseball; and you
who live in the big league cities, if you want to see
some of these boys play, you can do so almost any
day from April to October. These fellows are just
as much the heroes of the game to-day as they were
at Lowell. They like to play the game for the fun
there is in it as much as the profit. They like it for
its thrilling situations and its excitement. They love
to see the big crowds and when the stands are filled
and they have to let the crowd out on the field they
play their best and they all are just as anxious to
win every game, as they were back in those good old
days at Lowell.</p>

<small>SATO WRITES HOME</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Sato, the only member of the Jap nation at the
university that year, had not attended any of the
games at Lowell up to this time, but the excitement
around the school caused him to follow the crowd one
day, and afterwards he wrote home to Prince Igo,
his father, his impressions of the great National Game
as follows:</p>

<p>“Baseballing is great college sport presently. I
walk to-day much distance to where town ceases and
come against high board fences; also law guardian,
from which issue big noises frequent. Then silence
great. Soon of each more. I ask law guardian why
such yells.</p>

<p>“<a href="#image48">He reply,</a> ‘It is the fans. <a href="#image48">Man came home.</a>’

</div>

<p>“‘Away long time has gentlemen been?’ In interrogate.</p>

<p>“He answer, ‘Been long time since he came home
before.’</p>

<p>“Then I approach said gates of welcoming and
enter one saying grand stand, giving printed pasteboard
to much red-faced man at door.</p>

<p>“He destroy said printing and present to me one-half;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the other he keep. On honorable pasteboard
is printed ‘rain check’ and I presently comprehend
thus the stopping rain in great United States when
baseballing is to happen.</p>

<p>“I proceed along walkboard continuous until
emerging into great pavilion where persons numerous
are all sitting in seats many, but I see not the fans
law guardian promised, though it is day warm very.
Presently spectators make grand stand shouting the
Big Banzai as honorables in white suits run very hard.</p>

<p>“‘What is it?’ I remark to enormous German
intelligence on left.</p>

<p>“‘Another man home,’ he correspond.</p>

<p>“I am much enthusiasm also. It is more august
noise than Russian surrendering.</p>

<p>“Presently, Mr. Gray Pitch lift strong arm
holding white ball of much hardness high. Another
Gray Mr., the Hon. Catch, has responsibility for
all balls Mr. Pitch shoot and he try to stop all. The
ball shoots with swiftness great so Mr. Catch wear
large cushions on hands, also bird cage on face, with
boards in front of legs. Third Mr. what they call
Bat is positioned in front Mr. Catch to make
impossible said stopping by hitting ball.</p>

<p>“Of a suddenness Mr. Gray Pitch preparation
himself for enjoyable spasm. Ball holding high, he
make large twistings, himself turn half way, leg
raises and quickly shoots little ball straight at Mr.
Catch’s head. Hon. Bat makes large effort vainly.</p>

<p>“‘Strike one,’ gleefully announces Hon. Empire
in loud voice.</p>

<p>“Again Mr. Pitch make necessary, twists
preparation to his shoot. Mr. Bat fail making
attempt but Hon. Empire cries agonizing, ‘Struck
two,’ at which thin Irish spectacles on right speaking
violently remark, ‘Robber! Thief! Kill the
Empire!’</p>

<p>“I look expectant to witness demise of Hon.
Empire, but it happens not immediate. Much
disappoint I feel, having extreme good sitting for
witness such scenes. Then, think perhaps it later will
occurrence when dark.</p>

<p>“Once more Mr. Gray Pitch causing ball shoot
fast. But Mr. Bat watching very close. He make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
great smash with large stick against middle of small
ball and at once change name to Mr. Run, making
great haste leaving home for first white cushion.
Then turn, with much glee, from all standers up, on
left side and hasten quick after direction ball went
toward number two cushion. Mr. Gray Field now
pick up ball quick and throw at Mr. Run.</p>

<p>“All grand standers now project loud shoutings
of ‘Make slidings, Mr. Run. Make big slidings, Oh
run,’ and answeringly Hon. Run sliding on his
stomach to No. Two cushion, but Hon. Empire wave
his hand and say quickly, ‘Out’ and Hon. Run then
walk with much slowness and mutterings of words to
waterpail and drink.</p>

<p>“Presently when Hon. White Suits are much
weary from hittings and slidings they exchanging
places with Hon. Gray Suits and Gray Suits play
Mr. Bat.</p>

<p>“The Mr. White Pitch try to make great original
twistings and shoots. Mr. Gray Bat finds hitting
impossible and Hon. Empire says, ‘Struck three,
out.’ But now the Hon. Irish on right do not cry
‘Robber! Kill him!’ Himself and all others surrounding
make more standings and cheer Mr. White
Pitch magnitudinous and say, ‘Oh, you pitch!’</p>

<p>“After more twistings by White Pitch, Mr. Next
Bat walk leisure to one cushion. Mr. Third Bat
likewise.</p>

<p>“Suddenly boy diminutive with large voice in front
say, ‘Get the hook’ and then Mr. White Pitch drop
was white ball and retire and I wait for him return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
with hook, but I am distracted otherwise, seeing
bigger White Pitch proceed and pick up ball. Then
still more different twists by Mr. Bigger White Pitch
and swift shoots. Supreme big effort by Mr. Gray
Bat and loud crack.</p>

<p>“‘Fowl,’ say Empire and three runnings of white
suits. I arise to look at white suits chasing fowl,
but impossible to see account front rows standing on
seats. Next yellings, ‘He’s got it,’ and sitting down
of all, and I see Mr. Big Pitch holding ball upraised,
but no chicken. I think they catching fowl outside
for big dinner to homecomers.</p>

<p>“Now Mr. Second Bat run quickly to three
cushion and Mr. Now Bat propel ball with stick very
far; but Mr. White Field catch quick and throw to
Hon. Catch while Mr. Three Cushion occupant
running home.</p>

<p>“‘Safe,’ say Hon. Empire at which all bystanders
yell angrily, ‘Robber! Thief! Hang him!’ I
climb nearby post to witness national mode of death
and see all white suits surrounding Hon. Empire,
but no rope.</p>

<p>“Presently all walk away and again I am
disappoint, having much finer location for view such
interesting proceedings.</p>

<p>“Then more of same twistings and runnings by
both white suits and gray suits exchanging places
until dark, when grand standings make big runnings
to outside.</p>

<p>“I wait much patiently to see Hon. Empire get
hangings now but presently Mr. August Watch come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
by and say, ‘G’wan, game’s over,’ with many
pointings to outside and I consider possible I find
Hon. Empire and all white suits over fence making
big killings, so I exit myself through glee gates backward
where I find only majestic stillness.</p>

<p class="noi subtitle">A BASEBALL STORY</p>

<p class="noi author">By CHRISTOPHER MATHEWSON</p>

<p class ="noi smfont">The Famous Pitcher of the New York Giants. The first of a series of Boys’
Stories on Sports to be known as the MATTY BOOKS, by Christopher
Mathewson and W. W. Aulick, the well-known sporting writer, who will also
act as editor of the series.</p>

<p class="cap">It is a college story about baseball. The hero is a fine young
fellow whom many fans will at once think they recognize as
a popular player. He enters a big Eastern University from
the far West, gets on the Varsity after many trying experiences, as
extra pitcher, but by accident one day it develops his natural
position is as fielder and he becomes a star and wins a scholarship,
which insures his education.</p>

<p>Throughout the story the author describes thrilling moments of
actual games, some wonderful catches, and gives many stories, some
of them humorous, of famous players and games.</p>

<p>He also reveals some of the secrets of “inside baseball,” “signals,”
etc., and in a supplement, illustrations and descriptions of the way he
holds and delivers his famous Fade-away and other deceptive curves.</p>

<p>The description and playing characteristics of many of the hero’s
team-mates remind one of famous players of the present day. The
author has placed in one college boys who from their ball-playing
ability might easily be taken to represent his selection of a first ALL-AMERICAN
TEAM and in a rival college the boys whom he
might pick for ALL-AMERICAN TEAM No. 2. The games
played might also be taken to represent his idea of what would
occur in a series between two such teams. Mathewson’s position
in the game and his knowledge of the players fit him especially for
this, and the book should be read eagerly by players and fans.</p>

<div class="caption">Mathewson’s Fade Away Ball—The ball is held lightly with the forefingers and thumb, and a slow twist is given
to it. It sails up to the plate as dead as a brick, and, when mixed in with a speedy straight or in-ball, causes
the batter to often strike at it before it reaches him. It is a “teaser” for the third strike.</div>

<div class="caption">Mathewson’s Drop-curve—His most effective ball, and he has wonderful control of it. In fact, he makes it “talk.”
The two forefingers and the thumb give the rotary motion necessary for the curve, while a downward swing
and quick snap of the wrist give it the quick dropping kink.</div>

<div class="caption">Mathewson’s High In-ball—This is a most wicked delivery—the whisker trimmer. The thumb touches the ball
very lightly and the forefingers grasp it firmly. This delivery is used mostly to drive the batter away from
the plate so as to make the curve more effective. It is a dangerous ball to stand up against.</div>

<div class="caption">The Straight, Swift Ball—Mathewson gets tremendous speed
with this delivery, said to excel that of the famous “Hoosier
Cyclone,” Amos Rusie, when in his prime. The arm is swung
straight over the shoulder, with no wrist movement.</div>

<div class="caption">The out-curve is produced usually by grasping the ball with the first
two fingers and the thumb, with the back of the hand turned
downward. The fingers are pressed firmly against the ball, which
is gripped tight. The out-curve may be either fast or slow.</div><br />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image56.jpg" width="600" height="472" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">The in-curve is pitched with a side-arm motion, the ball being released
over the tips of the first two fingers, the arm being swept around
with a lateral motion. Some pitchers throw an in-curve by grasping
the ball with all four fingers and permitting it to slip over the tips.</div>
